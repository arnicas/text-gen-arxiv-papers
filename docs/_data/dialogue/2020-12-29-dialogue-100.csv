Robust Dialogue Utterance Rewriting as Sequence Tagging,2020-12-29 00:05:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14535v1,"Jie Hao, Linfeng Song, Liwei Wang, Kun Xu, Zhaopeng Tu, Dong Yu",cs.CL,dialogue,"The task of dialogue rewriting aims to reconstruct the latest dialogue
utterance by copying the missing content from the dialogue context. Until now,
the existing models for this task suffer from the robustness issue, i.e.,
performances drop dramatically when testing on a different domain. We address
this robustness issue by proposing a novel sequence-tagging-based model so that
the search space is significantly reduced, yet the core of this task is still
well covered. As a common issue of most tagging models for text generation, the
model's outputs may lack fluency. To alleviate this issue, we inject the loss
signal from BLEU or GPT-2 under a REINFORCE framework. Experiments show huge
improvements of our model over the current state-of-the-art systems on domain

optimally train and control the generation of intent-specific sentences using a
conditional variational autoencoder. Then we introduce a new protocol called
query transfer that allows to leverage a large unlabelled dataset, possibly
containing irrelevant queries, to extract relevant information. Comparison with
two different baselines shows that this method, in the appropriate regime,
consistently improves the diversity of the generated queries without
compromising their quality. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our

language model during text generation. Such an issue is particularly prevalent
when RNN-based VAE models are employed for text modelling. In this paper, we
propose a simple, generic architecture called Timestep-Wise Regularisation VAE

decor and service. Initial experiments with a baseline neural
sequence-to-sequence model show that this task is surprisingly challenging. We
then develop a novel self-training method that identifies (errorful) model
outputs, automatically constructs a corrected MR input to form a new (MR,

also propose a two-stage training scheme to boost performance. Empirical
results show that the adversarial training can effectively improve the quality

(NLG) models. Automatic metrics such as BLEU rely on references, but for tasks
such as open-ended generation, there are no references to draw upon. Although
language diversity can be estimated using statistical measures such as
perplexity, measuring language quality requires human evaluation. However,
because human evaluation at scale is slow and expensive, it is used sparingly;
it cannot be used to rapidly iterate on NLG models, in the way BLEU is used for
machine translation. To this end, we propose BLEU Neighbors, a nearest
neighbors model for estimating language quality by using the BLEU score as a
kernel function. On existing datasets for chitchat dialogue and open-ended
sentence generation, we find that -- on average -- the quality estimation from
a BLEU Neighbors model has a lower mean squared error and higher Spearman

locally normalized models which predict one word at a time. While these work

order to make training tractable, we first work in the residual of a pretrained
locally normalized language model and second we train using noise contrastive

leverage pretrained bi-directional contextual representations, such as BERT and

important and thriving area, covering traditional approaches, statistical
approaches and also approaches that use deep neural networks. We provide a
comprehensive review towards building open domain dialogue systems, an
important application of natural language generation. We find that,
predominantly, the approaches for building dialogue systems use seq2seq or
language models architecture. Notably, we identify three important areas of
further research towards building more effective dialogue systems: 1)
incorporating larger context, including conversation context and world
knowledge; 2) adding personae or personality in the NLG system; and 3)
overcoming dull and generic responses that affect the quality of
system-produced responses. We provide pointers on how to tackle these open

the length of the generated text samples is long (more than 20 words). In this
paper, we propose a new framework, called LeakGAN, to address the problem for
long text generation. We allow the discriminative net to leak its own
high-level extracted features to the generative net to further help the
guidance. The generator incorporates such informative signals into all
generation steps through an additional Manager module, which takes the
extracted features of current generated words and outputs a latent vector to
guide the Worker module for next-word generation. Our extensive experiments on
synthetic data and various real-world tasks with Turing test demonstrate that
LeakGAN is highly effective in long text generation and also improves the
performance in short text generation scenarios. More importantly, without any
supervision, LeakGAN would be able to implicitly learn sentence structures only
through the interaction between Manager and Worker.",2017-09-24

applying it to personal narratives from weblogs. We then take advantage of

dialogue responses are expressed on narrower domains and exhibit lower
diversity. It is thus reasonable to think that these automated metrics would
correlate well with human judgment in the task-oriented setting where the
generation task consists of translating dialogue acts into a sentence. We
conduct an empirical study to confirm whether this is the case. Our findings
indicate that these automated metrics have stronger correlation with human
judgments in the task-oriented setting compared to what has been observed in
the non task-oriented setting. We also observe that these metrics correlate

directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we

procedure is sufficient to capture a wealth of high-level discourse semantics.
Such procedure allows training the multiresolution recurrent neural network by
maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. In contrast to
