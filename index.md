# [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/) Text Generation Paper Searches

This site was meant to help me (Lynn Cherny) keep up with text generation topics of interest to me posted to [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/). Maybe it will help others?  These are the rough categories of work I'm crawling via API searches.  You can find the actual search terms on the [About]({{site.url}}pages/about.html) page.

* [Story / Narrative]({{site.url}}categories/story/story.html)
* [Dialogue]({{site.url}}categories/dialogue/dialogue.html)
* [Image2Text]({{site.url}}categories/image2text/image2text.html)
* [Games]({{site.url}}categories/games/games.html)
* [Poetry and Lyrics]({{site.url}}categories/poetry/poetry.html)
* [Knowledge Graphs]({{site.url}}categories/knowledge/knowledge.html)

There are also some links (in progress, I have a lot to get thru) to articles, demos, repos, and other things that aren't ArXiv papers [here]({{site.url}}pages/non_arxiv_links.html).

Like this?  It took way too much time because Jekyll isn't good at categories and I'm not good at Jekyll. :)  Gh-pages is more confusing than I remember.  [Buy me a 🍺 beer or ☕ coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/svcB4UR) or a [Kofi](https://ko-fi.com/arnicas).
