  retrosynthesis and reaction prediction",2021-10-19 01:23:15+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09681v1,"Zhengkai Tu, Connor W. Coley",cs.LG,knowledge,"Synthesis planning and reaction outcome prediction are two fundamental
problems in computer-aided organic chemistry for which a variety of data-driven
approaches have emerged. Natural language approaches that model each problem as
a SMILES-to-SMILES translation lead to a simple end-to-end formulation, reduce
the need for data preprocessing, and enable the use of well-optimized machine
translation model architectures. However, SMILES representations are not an
efficient representation for capturing information about molecular structures,
as evidenced by the success of SMILES augmentation to boost empirical
performance. Here, we describe a novel Graph2SMILES model that combines the
power of Transformer models for text generation with the permutation invariance
of molecular graph encoders that mitigates the need for input data
augmentation. As an end-to-end architecture, Graph2SMILES can be used as a
drop-in replacement for the Transformer in any task involving
molecule(s)-to-molecule(s) transformations. In our encoder, an
attention-augmented directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) captures
local chemical environments, and the global attention encoder allows for
long-range and intermolecular interactions, enhanced by graph-aware positional
embedding. Graph2SMILES improves the top-1 accuracy of the Transformer
baselines by $1.7\%$ and $1.9\%$ for reaction outcome prediction on USPTO_480k
and USPTO_STEREO datasets respectively, and by $9.8\%$ for one-step
retrosynthesis on the USPTO_50k dataset.",2021-10-19

two approaches outperform strong baselines on various text classification

semantic representation of the input sentence won't be significantly affected
by adversarial perturbations, and the model's performance drops less under
adversarial attack. That is to say, our approaches can effectively improve the

which could lead to bias in hiring decisions, regardless of whether hiring
decisions are made algorithmically or by humans. We propose a VAE-based
framework that obfuscates stylistic features of human-generated text through

operationalizes the notion of obfuscated style in a flexible way that enables
two distinct notions of obfuscated style: (1) a minimal notion that effectively
intersects the various styles seen in training, and (2) a maximal notion that
seeks to obfuscate by adding stylistic features of all sensitive attributes to
text, in effect, computing a union of styles. Our style-obfuscation framework

arguments in text, is usually formulated as a classification or structured
prediction problem. Such models usually reduce labels to numeric identifiers,
making them unable to take advantage of label semantics (e.g. an event type
named Arrest is related to words like arrest, detain, or apprehend). This
prevents the generalization to new event types. In this work, we formulate EE
as a natural language generation task and propose GenEE, a model that not only
captures complex dependencies within an event but also generalizes well to
unseen or rare event types. Given a passage and an event type, GenEE is trained
to generate a natural sentence following a predefined template for that event
type. The generated output is then decoded into trigger and argument
predictions. The autoregressive generation process naturally models the
dependencies among the predictions -- each new word predicted depends on those
already generated in the output sentence. Using carefully designed input
prompts during generation, GenEE is able to capture label semantics, which
enables the generalization to new event types. Empirical results show that our
model achieves strong performance on event extraction tasks under all

present Lingxi, a diversity-aware Chinese modern poetry generation system. We

with traditional sampling methods. The permutation of distribution is
controllable by tuning the filtering parameter that determines the ""head"" to
permutate, achieving diversity-aware sampling. We find that even when a large

abbreviations, or scientific formulas which are commonly used in academic

goal. A growing body of research directs this goal towards augmenting the
creative writing abilities of human authors. In this paper, we pursue this
objective by analyzing how observing examples of automatically generated text
influences writing. In particular, we examine a task referred to as sentence
infilling, which involves transforming a list of words into a complete
sentence. We emphasize ""storiability"" as a desirable feature of the resulting
sentences, where ""storiable"" sentences are those that suggest a story a reader
would be curious to hear about. Both humans and an automated system (based on a
neural language model) performed this sentence infilling task. In one setting,
people wrote sentences on their own; in a different setting, people observed
the sentences produced by the model while writing their own sentences. Readers
then assigned storiability preferences to the resulting sentences in a
subsequent evaluation. We find that human-authored sentences were judged as
more storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that
storiability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the
examples. This result gives evidence of an ""inspiration through observation""
paradigm for human-computer collaborative writing, through which human writing
can be enhanced by text generation models without directly copying their

grammatical texts. While earlier language models suffered from repetition and
syntactic errors, the errors made by contemporary models are often semantic,

  To facilitate research of these complex error types, we introduce a new

categories used in Scarecrow -- such as redundancy, commonsense errors, and
incoherence -- were identified by combining expert analysis with several pilot
rounds of ontology-free crowd annotation to arrive at a schema which covers the
error phenomena found in real machine generated text.
  We use Scarecrow to collect 13k annotations of 1.3k human and machine
generate paragraphs of English language news text, amounting to over 41k spans
each labeled with its error category, severity, a natural language explanation,
and antecedent span (where relevant). We collect annotations for text generated

Small through the largest GPT-3. We isolate several factors for detailed
analysis, including parameter count, training data, and decoding technique. Our
results show both expected and surprising differences across these settings.

proposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays
are fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features
would be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network
which only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared
with the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge

could exploit more structural and semantic information of the commonsense

propose novel approaches for controlling encoder-decoder transformer-based NLG
models in zero-shot. This is done by introducing three control knobs, namely,
attention biasing, decoder mixing, and context augmentation, that are applied
to these models at generation time. These knobs control the generation process
by directly manipulating trained NLG models (e.g., biasing cross-attention

that not only are these NLG models robust to such manipulations, but also their

These results, to the best of our knowledge, are the first of their kind.
Through these control knobs, we also investigate the role of transformer

where a model answers a multiple-choice question for a certain context.
Discriminative tasks are limiting because they fail to adequately evaluate the

""right for the right reasons"". In this work, we present ExplaGraphs, a new
generative and structured commonsense-reasoning task (and an associated
dataset) of explanation graph generation for stance prediction. Specifically,
given a belief and an argument, a model has to predict whether the argument
supports or counters the belief and also generate a commonsense-augmented graph
that serves as non-trivial, complete, and unambiguous explanation for the
predicted stance. The explanation graphs for our dataset are collected via
crowdsourcing through a novel Collect-Judge-And-Refine graph collection
framework that improves the graph quality via multiple rounds of verification
and refinement. A significant 83% of our graphs contain external commonsense
nodes with diverse structures and reasoning depths. We also propose a
multi-level evaluation framework that checks for the structural and semantic
correctness of the generated graphs and their plausibility with human-written

parsers to map utterances to semantic frames proceeds in three steps: encoding
an utterance $x$, predicting a frame's length |y|, and decoding a |y|-sized

models are typically bottle necked by length prediction, as even small
inaccuracies change the syntactic and semantic characteristics of resulting
frames. In our work, we propose span pointer networks, non-autoregressive
parsers which shift the decoding task from text generation to span prediction;
that is, when imputing utterance spans into frame slots, our model produces
endpoints (e.g., [i, j]) as opposed to text (e.g., ""6pm""). This natural
quantization of the output space reduces the variability of gold frames,
therefore improving length prediction and, ultimately, exact match.
Furthermore, length prediction is now responsible for frame syntax and the
decoder is responsible for frame semantics, resulting in a coarse-to-fine
model. We evaluate our approach on several task-oriented semantic parsing
datasets. Notably, we bridge the quality gap between non-autogressive and
autoregressive parsers, achieving 87 EM on TOPv2 (Chen et al. 2020).
Furthermore,due to our more consistent gold frames, we show strong improvements
in model generalization in both cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer in

human-level performance from state-of-the-art models. In this work, we
specifically focus on the Commongen benchmark, wherein the aim is to generate a
plausible sentence for a given set of input concepts. Despite advances in other
tasks, large pre-trained language models that are fine-tuned on this dataset
often produce sentences that are syntactically correct but qualitatively
deviate from a human understanding of common sense. Furthermore, generated
sequences are unable to fulfill such lexical requirements as matching
part-of-speech and full concept coverage. In this paper, we explore how
commonsense knowledge graphs can enhance model performance, with respect to
commonsense reasoning and lexically-constrained decoding. We propose strategies
for enhancing the semantic correctness of the generated text, which we
accomplish through: extracting commonsense relations from Conceptnet, injecting
these relations into the Unified Language Model (UniLM) through attention
mechanisms, and enforcing the aforementioned lexical requirements through
output constraints. By performing several ablations, we find that commonsense

inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome
requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the
implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a
ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be
accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective
mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist
and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent
training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider
practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective
mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional
variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting
surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in
both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output
diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical
motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed
CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective
mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with
known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural
language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical
surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one

algorithms, especially in NLP, rely on the accessibility of the original
training dataset, which may be unavailable due to privacy issues. To tackle
this problem, we propose a novel two-stage data-free distillation method, named
Adversarial self-Supervised Data-Free Distillation (AS-DFD), which is designed
for compressing large-scale transformer-based models (e.g., BERT). To avoid
text generation in discrete space, we introduce a Plug & Play Embedding
Guessing method to craft pseudo embeddings from the teacher's hidden knowledge.
Meanwhile, with a self-supervised module to quantify the student's ability, we
adapt the difficulty of pseudo embeddings in an adversarial training manner. To
the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first data-free distillation
framework designed for NLP tasks. We verify the effectiveness of our method on
several text classification datasets.",2020-10-10

alleviate the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we propose a novel guider
network to focus on the generative process over a longer horizon, which can
assist next-word prediction and provide intermediate rewards for generator
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method leads
to improved performance.",2020-05-04

natural language descriptions. Most existing methods ignore the faithfulness
between a generated text description and the original table, leading to
generated information that goes beyond the content of the table. In this paper,
for the first time, we propose a novel Transformer-based generation framework
to achieve the goal. The core techniques in our method to enforce faithfulness
include a new table-text optimal-transport matching loss and a table-text
embedding similarity loss based on the Transformer model. Furthermore, to
evaluate faithfulness, we propose a new automatic metric specialized to the
table-to-text generation problem. We also provide detailed analysis on each
component of our model in our experiments. Automatic and human evaluations show
that our framework can significantly outperform state-of-the-art by a large

APo-VAE: Text Generation in Hyperbolic Space,2020-04-30 19:05:41+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00054v1,"Shuyang Dai, Zhe Gan, Yu Cheng, Chenyang Tao, Lawrence Carin, Jingjing Liu","cs.LG, stat.ML",knowledge,"Natural language often exhibits inherent hierarchical structure ingrained
with complex syntax and semantics. However, most state-of-the-art deep
generative models learn embeddings only in Euclidean vector space, without
accounting for this structural property of language. In this paper, we
investigate text generation in a hyperbolic latent space to learn continuous
hierarchical representations. An Adversarial Poincare Variational Autoencoder
(APo-VAE) is presented, where both the prior and variational posterior of
latent variables are defined over a Poincare ball via wrapped normal
distributions. By adopting the primal-dual formulation of KL divergence, an
adversarial learning procedure is introduced to empower robust model training.
Extensive experiments in language modeling and dialog-response generation tasks
demonstrate the winning effectiveness of the proposed APo-VAE model over VAEs
in Euclidean latent space, thanks to its superb capabilities in capturing
latent language hierarchies in hyperbolic space.",2020-04-30
Context based Text-generation using LSTM networks,2020-04-30 18:39:25+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00048v1,Sivasurya Santhanam,"cs.CL, cs.LG",knowledge,"Long short-term memory(LSTM) units on sequence-based models are being used in
translation, question-answering systems, classification tasks due to their
capability of learning long-term dependencies. In Natural language generation,
LSTM networks are providing impressive results on text generation models by
learning language models with grammatically stable syntaxes. But the downside
is that the network does not learn about the context. The network only learns
the input-output function and generates text given a set of input words
irrespective of pragmatics. As the model is trained without any such context,
there is no semantic consistency among the generated sentences. The proposed
model is trained to generate text for a given set of input words along with a
context vector. A context vector is similar to a paragraph vector that grasps
the semantic meaning(context) of the sentence. Several methods of extracting
the context vectors are proposed in this work. While training a language model,
in addition to the input-output sequences, context vectors are also trained
along with the inputs. Due to this structure, the model learns the relation
among the input words, context vector and the target word. Given a set of
context terms, a well trained model will generate text around the provided
context. Based on the nature of computing context vectors, the model has been
tried out with two variations (word importance and word clustering). In the
word clustering method, the suitable embeddings among various domains are also
explored. The results are evaluated based on the semantic closeness of the
generated text to the given context.",2020-04-30

Language Generation (NLG) using a single domain-independent model across a
large number of APIs. First, we propose a schema-guided approach which
conditions the generation on a schema describing the API in natural language.
Our second method investigates the use of a small number of templates, growing
linearly in number of slots, to convey the semantics of the API. To generate
utterances for an arbitrary slot combination, a few simple templates are first
concatenated to give a semantically correct, but possibly incoherent and
ungrammatical utterance. A pre-trained language model is subsequently employed
to rewrite it into coherent, natural sounding text. Through automatic metrics
and human evaluation, we show that our method improves over strong baselines,
is robust to out-of-domain inputs and shows improved sample efficiency.",2020-04-30

triples or key-value pairs conveying the knowledge of some entities to generate
a natural language description. Existing datasets, such as WIKIBIO, WebNLG, and
E2E, basically have a good alignment between an input triple/pair set and its
output text. However, in practice, the input knowledge could be more than
enough, since the output description may only cover the most significant
knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale and challenging dataset to
facilitate the study of such a practical scenario in KG-to-text. Our dataset
involves retrieving abundant knowledge of various types of main entities from a
large knowledge graph (KG), which makes the current graph-to-sequence models
severely suffer from the problems of information loss and parameter explosion
while generating the descriptions. We address these challenges by proposing a
multi-graph structure that is able to represent the original graph information
more comprehensively. Furthermore, we also incorporate aggregation methods that
learn to extract the rich graph information. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our model architecture.",2020-04-30

The prior work is the first attempt that utilized the duality between NLU and
NLG to improve the performance via a dual supervised learning framework.
However, the prior work still learned both components in a supervised manner,
instead, this paper introduces a general learning framework to effectively
exploit such duality, providing flexibility of incorporating both supervised

primarily focused on surface-level descriptions of record sequences. However,
for complex structured data, e.g., multi-row tables, it is often desirable for
an NLG system to describe interesting facts from logical inferences across
records. If only provided with the table, it is hard for existing models to
produce controllable and high-fidelity logical generations. In this work, we
formulate logical level NLG as generation from logical forms in order to obtain
controllable, high-fidelity, and faithful generations. We present a new
large-scale dataset, \textsc{Logic2Text}, with 10,753 descriptions involving
common logic types paired with the underlying logical forms. The logical forms
show diversified graph structure of free schema, which poses great challenges
on the model's ability to understand the semantics. We experiment on (1)
Fully-supervised training with the full datasets, and (2) Few-shot setting,
provided with hundreds of paired examples; We compare several popular
generation models and analyze their performances. We hope our dataset can
encourage research towards building an advanced NLG system capable of natural,
