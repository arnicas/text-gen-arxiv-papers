"DiscoDVT: Generating Long Text with Discourse-Aware Discrete Variational
  Transformer",2021-10-12 13:41:06+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05999v1,"Haozhe Ji, Minlie Huang",cs.CL,story,"Despite the recent advances in applying pre-trained language models to
generate high-quality texts, generating long passages that maintain long-range
coherence is yet challenging for these models. In this paper, we propose
DiscoDVT, a discourse-aware discrete variational Transformer to tackle the
incoherence issue. DiscoDVT learns a discrete variable sequence that summarizes
the global structure of the text and then applies it to guide the generation
process at each decoding step. To further embed discourse-aware information
into the discrete latent representations, we introduce an auxiliary objective
to model the discourse relations within the text. We conduct extensive
experiments on two open story generation datasets and demonstrate that the
latent codes learn meaningful correspondence to the discourse structures that
guide the model to generate long texts with better long-range coherence.",2021-10-12
A guided journey through non-interactive automatic story generation,2021-10-08 10:01:36+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11167v1,Luis Miguel Botelho,"cs.CL, cs.AI",story,"We present a literature survey on non-interactive computational story

technology: story-schemas, analogy, rules, planning, evolutionary algorithms,
implicit knowledge learning, and explicit knowledge learning. Before the
concluding section, the article analyses the contributions of the reviewed work
to improve the quality of the generated stories. This analysis addresses the
description of the story characters, the use of narrative knowledge including

concluding remarks in the form of suggestions of research topics that might
have a significant impact on the advancement of the state of the art on
autonomous non-interactive story generation systems. The article concludes that
the autonomous generation and adoption of the main idea to be conveyed and the

produce fluent text. Yet even when starting from a prompt, generation can
continue in many plausible directions. Current decoding methods with the goal
of controlling generation, e.g., to ensure specific words are included, either

is semantically unconstrained, e.g., story generation. In this work, we present
a plug-and-play decoding method for controlled language generation that is so
simple and intuitive, it can be described in a single sentence: given a topic

towards semantically similar words. We show how annealing this distribution can
be used to impose hard constraints on language generation, something no other
plug-and-play method is currently able to do with SOTA language generators.
Despite the simplicity of this approach, we see it works incredibly well in
practice: decoding from GPT-2 leads to diverse and fluent sentences while
guaranteeing the appearance of given guide words. We perform two user studies,
revealing that (1) our method outperforms competing methods in human
evaluations; and (2) forcing the guide words to appear in the generated text

Furthermore, we can learn to model text coherence by learning how to order a

For idea reasoning, two architectures \textbf{SSR-AR} and \textbf{SSR-NonAR}

more storiable when authors observed the generated examples, and that
storiability increased as authors derived more semantic content from the

critical bottleneck of obtaining a reliable learnable evaluation metric is the
lack of high-quality training data for classifiers to efficiently distinguish
plausible and implausible machine-generated stories. Previous works relied on
\textit{heuristically manipulated} plausible examples to mimic possible system
drawbacks such as repetition, contradiction, or irrelevant content in the text

using {\em plots}, which are structured representations of controllable factors
used to generate stories. Since these plots are compact and structured, it is
easier to manipulate them to generate text with targeted undesirable
properties, while at the same time maintain the grammatical correctness and
naturalness of the generated sentences. To improve the quality of generated
implausible stories, we further apply the adversarial filtering procedure

insight to develop the follow-up story. In this paper, we formulate a long
story as a sequence of ""story blocks,"" where each block contains a fixed number
of sentences (e.g., 10, 100, or 200). This formulation allows us to predict the
follow-up story arc beyond the scope of a few sentences. We represent a story
block using the term frequencies (TF) of semantic frames in it, normalized by
each frame's inverse document frequency (IDF). We conduct semantic frame
forecast experiments on 4,794 books from the Bookcorpus and 7,962 scientific

the counterfactual condition, from the original ending. In the customize stage,
a generation model is used to fill proper words in the skeleton under the

counterfactual ending is both relevant to the original ending and consistent

without paragraph breaker or EOS during pre-training. Experimental results show
that the Chinese GPT2 can generate better essay endings with paragraph
information. Experiments on both English stories and Chinese essays demonstrate
that learning to end paragraphs can benefit the continuation generation with
pretrained LMs.",2020-04-05
Counterfactual Story Reasoning and Generation,2019-09-09 18:08:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04076v2,"Lianhui Qin, Antoine Bosselut, Ari Holtzman, Chandra Bhagavatula, Elizabeth Clark, Yejin Choi","cs.CL, cs.AI",story,"Counterfactual reasoning requires predicting how alternative events, contrary
to what actually happened, might have resulted in different outcomes. Despite
being considered a necessary component of AI-complete systems, few resources
have been developed for evaluating counterfactual reasoning in narratives.
  In this paper, we propose Counterfactual Story Rewriting: given an original
story and an intervening counterfactual event, the task is to minimally revise
the story to make it compatible with the given counterfactual event. Solving
this task will require deep understanding of causal narrative chains and
counterfactual invariance, and integration of such story reasoning capabilities
into conditional language generation models.
  We present TimeTravel, a new dataset of 29,849 counterfactual rewritings,
each with the original story, a counterfactual event, and human-generated
revision of the original story compatible with the counterfactual event.
Additionally, we include 80,115 counterfactual ""branches"" without a rewritten
storyline to support future work on semi- or un-supervised approaches to
counterfactual story rewriting.
  Finally, we evaluate the counterfactual rewriting capacities of several
competitive baselines based on pretrained language models, and assess whether
common overlap and model-based automatic metrics for text generation correlate
well with human scores for counterfactual rewriting.",2019-09-09
WriterForcing: Generating more interesting story endings,2019-07-18 19:29:29+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08259v1,"Prakhar Gupta, Vinayshekhar Bannihatti Kumar, Mukul Bhutani, Alan W Black","cs.LG, cs.CL, stat.ML",story,"We study the problem of generating interesting endings for stories. Neural
generative models have shown promising results for various text generation
problems. Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) models are typically trained to
generate a single output sequence for a given input sequence. However, in the
context of a story, multiple endings are possible. Seq2Seq models tend to
ignore the context and generate generic and dull responses. Very few works have
studied generating diverse and interesting story endings for a given story
context. In this paper, we propose models which generate more diverse and
interesting outputs by 1) training models to focus attention on important
keyphrases of the story, and 2) promoting generation of non-generic words. We
show that the combination of the two leads to more diverse and interesting
endings.",2019-07-18
Towards Content Transfer through Grounded Text Generation,2019-05-13 21:36:43+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05293v1,"Shrimai Prabhumoye, Chris Quirk, Michel Galley",cs.CL,story,"Recent work in neural generation has attracted significant interest in
controlling the form of text, such as style, persona, and politeness. However,
there has been less work on controlling neural text generation for content.
This paper introduces the notion of Content Transfer for long-form text
generation, where the task is to generate a next sentence in a document that
both fits its context and is grounded in a content-rich external textual source
such as a news story. Our experiments on Wikipedia data show significant
improvements against competitive baselines. As another contribution of this
paper, we release a benchmark dataset of 640k Wikipedia referenced sentences
paired with the source articles to encourage exploration of this new task.",2019-05-13
Strategies for Structuring Story Generation,2019-02-04 10:23:39+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01109v2,"Angela Fan, Mike Lewis, Yann Dauphin",cs.CL,story,"Writers generally rely on plans or sketches to write long stories, but most
current language models generate word by word from left to right. We explore
coarse-to-fine models for creating narrative texts of several hundred words,
and introduce new models which decompose stories by abstracting over actions
and entities. The model first generates the predicate-argument structure of the
text, where different mentions of the same entity are marked with placeholder
tokens. It then generates a surface realization of the predicate-argument
structure, and finally replaces the entity placeholders with context-sensitive
names and references. Human judges prefer the stories from our models to a wide
range of previous approaches to hierarchical text generation. Extensive
analysis shows that our methods can help improve the diversity and coherence of
events and entities in generated stories.",2019-02-04
"Co-occurrence of the Benford-like and Zipf Laws Arising from the Texts
  Representing Human and Artificial Languages",2018-03-06 12:24:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03667v1,"Evgeny Shulzinger, Irina Legchenkova, Edward Bormashenko","cs.CL, physics.soc-ph, stat.OT",story,"We demonstrate that large texts, representing human (English, Russian,
Ukrainian) and artificial (C++, Java) languages, display quantitative patterns
characterized by the Benford-like and Zipf laws. The frequency of a word
following the Zipf law is inversely proportional to its rank, whereas the total
numbers of a certain word appearing in the text generate the uneven
Benford-like distribution of leading numbers. Excluding the most popular words
essentially improves the correlation of actual textual data with the Zipfian
distribution, whereas the Benford distribution of leading numbers (arising from
the overall amount of a certain word) is insensitive to the same elimination
procedure. The calculated values of the moduli of slopes of double
logarithmical plots for artificial languages (C++, Java) are markedly larger
than those for human ones.",2018-03-06
Story Generation from Sequence of Independent Short Descriptions,2017-07-18 07:08:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05501v2,"Parag Jain, Priyanka Agrawal, Abhijit Mishra, Mohak Sukhwani, Anirban Laha, Karthik Sankaranarayanan",cs.CL,story,"Existing Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems are weak AI systems and
exhibit limited capabilities when language generation tasks demand higher
levels of creativity, originality and brevity. Effective solutions or, at least
evaluations of modern NLG paradigms for such creative tasks have been elusive,
unfortunately. This paper introduces and addresses the task of coherent story
generation from independent descriptions, describing a scene or an event.
Towards this, we explore along two popular text-generation paradigms -- (1)
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), posing story generation as a translation
problem and (2) Deep Learning, posing story generation as a sequence to
sequence learning problem. In SMT, we chose two popular methods such as phrase
based SMT (PB-SMT) and syntax based SMT (SYNTAX-SMT) to `translate' the
incoherent input text into stories. We then implement a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that encodes sequence of variable length input
descriptions to corresponding latent representations and decodes them to
produce well formed comprehensive story like summaries. The efficacy of the
suggested approaches is demonstrated on a publicly available dataset with the
help of popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics.",2017-07-18
A Theme-Rewriting Approach for Generating Algebra Word Problems,2016-10-19 20:49:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06210v1,"Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Ioannis Konstas, Luke Zettlemoyer, Hannaneh Hajishirzi",cs.CL,story,"Texts present coherent stories that have a particular theme or overall
setting, for example science fiction or western. In this paper, we present a
text generation method called {\it rewriting} that edits existing
human-authored narratives to change their theme without changing the underlying
story. We apply the approach to math word problems, where it might help
students stay more engaged by quickly transforming all of their homework
assignments to the theme of their favorite movie without changing the math
concepts that are being taught. Our rewriting method uses a two-stage decoding
process, which proposes new words from the target theme and scores the
resulting stories according to a number of factors defining aspects of
syntactic, semantic, and thematic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that the
final stories typically represent the new theme well while still testing the
original math concepts, outperforming a number of baselines. We also release a
new dataset of human-authored rewrites of math word problems in several themes.",2016-10-19
