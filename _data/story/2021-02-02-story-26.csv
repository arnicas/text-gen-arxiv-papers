"MAUVE: Human-Machine Divergence Curves for Evaluating Open-Ended Text
  Generation",2021-02-02 11:59:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01454v1,"Krishna Pillutla, Swabha Swayamdipta, Rowan Zellers, John Thickstun, Yejin Choi, Zaid Harchaoui",cs.CL,story,"Despite major advances in open-ended text generation, there has been limited
progress in designing evaluation metrics for this task. We propose MAUVE -- a
metric for open-ended text generation, which directly compares the distribution
of machine-generated text to that of human language. MAUVE measures the mean
area under the divergence curve for the two distributions, exploring the
trade-off between two types of errors: those arising from parts of the human
distribution that the model distribution approximates well, and those it does
not. We present experiments across two open-ended generation tasks in the web
text domain and the story domain, and a variety of decoding algorithms and
model sizes. Our results show that evaluation under MAUVE indeed reflects the
more natural behavior with respect to model size, compared to prior metrics.
MAUVE's ordering of the decoding algorithms also agrees with that of generation
perplexity, the most widely used metric in open-ended text generation; however,
MAUVE presents a more principled evaluation metric for the task as it considers
both model and human text.",2021-02-02
Persistent Anti-Muslim Bias in Large Language Models,2021-01-14 18:41:55+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05783v2,"Abubakar Abid, Maheen Farooqi, James Zou","cs.CL, cs.LG",story,"It has been observed that large-scale language models capture undesirable
societal biases, e.g. relating to race and gender; yet religious bias has been
relatively unexplored. We demonstrate that GPT-3, a state-of-the-art contextual
language model, captures persistent Muslim-violence bias. We probe GPT-3 in
various ways, including prompt completion, analogical reasoning, and story
generation, to understand this anti-Muslim bias, demonstrating that it appears
consistently and creatively in different uses of the model and that it is
severe even compared to biases about other religious groups. For instance,
""Muslim"" is analogized to ""terrorist"" in 23% of test cases, while ""Jewish"" is
mapped to ""money"" in 5% of test cases. We quantify the positive distraction
needed to overcome this bias with adversarial text prompts, and find that use
of the most positive 6 adjectives reduces violent completions for ""Muslims""
from 66% to 20%, but which is still higher than for other religious groups.",2021-01-14
"Political Depolarization of News Articles Using Attribute-aware Word
  Embeddings",2021-01-05 07:39:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01391v1,"Ruibo Liu, Lili Wang, Chenyan Jia, Soroush Vosoughi","cs.CL, cs.AI",story,"Political polarization in the US is on the rise. This polarization negatively
affects the public sphere by contributing to the creation of ideological echo
chambers. In this paper, we focus on addressing one of the factors that
contributes to this polarity, polarized media. We introduce a framework for
depolarizing news articles. Given an article on a certain topic with a
particular ideological slant (eg., liberal or conservative), the framework
first detects polar language in the article and then generates a new article
with the polar language replaced with neutral expressions. To detect polar
words, we train a multi-attribute-aware word embedding model that is aware of
ideology and topics on 360k full-length media articles. Then, for text
generation, we propose a new algorithm called Text Annealing Depolarization
Algorithm (TADA). TADA retrieves neutral expressions from the word embedding
model that not only decrease ideological polarity but also preserve the
original argument of the text, while maintaining grammatical correctness. We
evaluate our framework by comparing the depolarized output of our model in two
modes, fully-automatic and semi-automatic, on 99 stories spanning 11 topics.
Based on feedback from 161 human testers, our framework successfully
depolarized 90.1% of paragraphs in semi-automatic mode and 78.3% of paragraphs
in fully-automatic mode. Furthermore, 81.2% of the testers agree that the
non-polar content information is well-preserved and 79% agree that
depolarization does not harm semantic correctness when they compare the
original text and the depolarized text. Our work shows that data-driven methods
can help to locate political polarity and aid in the depolarization of

first propose a new task named ""Outline to Story"" (O2S) as a test bed for
fine-grained controllable generation of long text, which generates a
multi-paragraph story from cascaded events, i.e. a sequence of outline events

Finally, we propose an extremely simple yet strong baseline method for the O2S
task, which fine tunes pre-trained language models on augmented sequences of
outline-story pairs with simple language modeling objective. Our method does
not introduce any new parameters or perform any architecture modification,
except several special tokens as delimiters to build augmented sequences.
Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art

Benford-like distribution of leading numbers. Excluding the most popular words
essentially improves the correlation of actual textual data with the Zipfian
distribution, whereas the Benford distribution of leading numbers (arising from
the overall amount of a certain word) is insensitive to the same elimination
procedure. The calculated values of the moduli of slopes of double
logarithmical plots for artificial languages (C++, Java) are markedly larger
than those for human ones.",2018-03-06
Story Generation from Sequence of Independent Short Descriptions,2017-07-18 07:08:31+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05501v2,"Parag Jain, Priyanka Agrawal, Abhijit Mishra, Mohak Sukhwani, Anirban Laha, Karthik Sankaranarayanan",cs.CL,story,"Existing Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems are weak AI systems and
exhibit limited capabilities when language generation tasks demand higher
levels of creativity, originality and brevity. Effective solutions or, at least
evaluations of modern NLG paradigms for such creative tasks have been elusive,
unfortunately. This paper introduces and addresses the task of coherent story
generation from independent descriptions, describing a scene or an event.
Towards this, we explore along two popular text-generation paradigms -- (1)
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), posing story generation as a translation
problem and (2) Deep Learning, posing story generation as a sequence to
sequence learning problem. In SMT, we chose two popular methods such as phrase
based SMT (PB-SMT) and syntax based SMT (SYNTAX-SMT) to `translate' the
incoherent input text into stories. We then implement a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that encodes sequence of variable length input
descriptions to corresponding latent representations and decodes them to
produce well formed comprehensive story like summaries. The efficacy of the
suggested approaches is demonstrated on a publicly available dataset with the
help of popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics.",2017-07-18
A Theme-Rewriting Approach for Generating Algebra Word Problems,2016-10-19 20:49:23+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06210v1,"Rik Koncel-Kedziorski, Ioannis Konstas, Luke Zettlemoyer, Hannaneh Hajishirzi",cs.CL,story,"Texts present coherent stories that have a particular theme or overall
setting, for example science fiction or western. In this paper, we present a
text generation method called {\it rewriting} that edits existing
human-authored narratives to change their theme without changing the underlying
story. We apply the approach to math word problems, where it might help
students stay more engaged by quickly transforming all of their homework
assignments to the theme of their favorite movie without changing the math
concepts that are being taught. Our rewriting method uses a two-stage decoding
process, which proposes new words from the target theme and scores the
resulting stories according to a number of factors defining aspects of
syntactic, semantic, and thematic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that the
final stories typically represent the new theme well while still testing the
original math concepts, outperforming a number of baselines. We also release a
new dataset of human-authored rewrites of math word problems in several themes.",2016-10-19
