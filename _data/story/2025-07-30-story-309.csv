that are culturally relevant to other nationalities? To find out, we generated
11,800 stories - 50 for each of 236 countries - by sending the prompt ""Write a
1500 word potential {demonym} story"" to OpenAI's model gpt-4o-mini. Although
the stories do include surface-level national symbols and themes, they
overwhelmingly conform to a single narrative plot structure across countries: a
protagonist lives in or returns home to a small town and resolves a minor
conflict by reconnecting with tradition and organising community events.
Real-world conflicts are sanitised, romance is almost absent, and narrative
tension is downplayed in favour of nostalgia and reconciliation. The result is
a narrative homogenisation: an AI-generated synthetic imaginary that
prioritises stability above change and tradition above growth. We argue that
the structural homogeneity of AI-generated narratives constitutes a distinct
form of AI bias, a narrative standardisation that should be acknowledged
alongside the more familiar representational bias. These findings are relevant
to literary studies, narratology, critical AI studies, NLP research, and

Ta-G-T: Subjectivity Capture in Table to Text Generation via RDF Graphs,2025-07-25 23:06:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19710v1,"Ronak Upasham, Tathagata Dey, Pushpak Bhattacharyya",cs.CL,story,"In Table-to-Text (T2T) generation, existing approaches predominantly focus on

objective and subjective text from tables. Our three-stage pipeline consists
of: 1) extraction of Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples, 2)
aggregation of text into coherent narratives, and 3) infusion of subjectivity

factual accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Unlike large language

smaller, fine-tuned T5 models while achieving comparable performance to GPT-3.5

Modeling Fair Play in Detective Stories with Language Models,2025-07-18 11:55:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13841v1,"Eitan Wagner, Renana Keydar, Omri Abend",cs.CL,story,"Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.",2025-07-18

FairyGen: Storied Cartoon Video from a Single Child-Drawn Character,2025-06-26 13:58:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21272v2,"Jiayi Zheng, Xiaodong Cun","cs.GR, cs.CV, cs.MM",story,"We propose FairyGen, an automatic system for generating story-driven cartoon
videos from a single child's drawing, while faithfully preserving its unique
artistic style. Unlike previous storytelling methods that primarily focus on
character consistency and basic motion, FairyGen explicitly disentangles
character modeling from stylized background generation and incorporates
cinematic shot design to support expressive and coherent storytelling. Given a
single character sketch, we first employ an MLLM to generate a structured
storyboard with shot-level descriptions that specify environment settings,
character actions, and camera perspectives. To ensure visual consistency, we
introduce a style propagation adapter that captures the character's visual
style and applies it to the background, faithfully retaining the character's
full visual identity while synthesizing style-consistent scenes. A shot design
module further enhances visual diversity and cinematic quality through frame
cropping and multi-view synthesis based on the storyboard. To animate the
story, we reconstruct a 3D proxy of the character to derive physically
plausible motion sequences, which are then used to fine-tune an MMDiT-based
image-to-video diffusion model. We further propose a two-stage motion
customization adapter: the first stage learns appearance features from
temporally unordered frames, disentangling identity from motion; the second
stage models temporal dynamics using a timestep-shift strategy with frozen
identity weights. Once trained, FairyGen directly renders diverse and coherent
video scenes aligned with the storyboard. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our system produces animations that are stylistically faithful,
narratively structured natural motion, highlighting its potential for
personalized and engaging story animation. The code will be available at

examining sampling temperature and top p which control the randomness of model

Constraint representation towards precise data-driven storytelling,2024-10-10 02:03:46+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07535v1,"Yu-Zhe Shi, Haotian Li, Lecheng Ruan, Huamin Qu",cs.HC,story,"Data-driven storytelling serves as a crucial bridge for communicating ideas
in a persuasive way. However, the manual creation of data stories is a
multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader
application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged
as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence,
the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their
hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down
manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding
insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These
dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a
data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data
story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and
articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with
seed ideas and contextualized evidence. We identify the taxonomy and required
functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous
and latent, we explore the potential to represent them in a
computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. We believe that
leveraging constraints will facilitate both artistic and scientific aspects of

short videos. However, ARMs often suffer from exponential error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to physically implausible results, while DMs are
limited by their local context generation capabilities. In this work, we
introduce Autoregressive Coherent multimodal generation with Diffusion
Correction (ACDC), a zero-shot approach that combines the strengths of both
ARMs and DMs at the inference stage without the need for additional
fine-tuning. ACDC leverages ARMs for global context generation and
memory-conditioned DMs for local correction, ensuring high-quality outputs by
correcting artifacts in generated multimodal tokens. In particular, we propose
a memory module based on large language models (LLMs) that dynamically adjusts
the conditioning texts for the DMs, preserving crucial global context

multi-frame story generation and autoregressive video generation, demonstrate
that ACDC effectively mitigates the accumulation of errors and significantly
enhances the quality of generated outputs, achieving superior performance while
remaining agnostic to specific ARM and DM architectures. Project page:

corresponding to textual narratives. Despite recent advances in diffusion
models yielding promising results, existing methods still struggle to create a
coherent sequence of subject-consistent frames based solely on a story. To this
end, we propose DreamStory, an automatic open-domain story visualization
framework by leveraging the LLMs and a novel multi-subject consistent diffusion
model. DreamStory consists of (1) an LLM acting as a story director and (2) an
innovative Multi-Subject consistent Diffusion model (MSD) for generating
consistent multi-subject across the images. First, DreamStory employs the LLM
to generate descriptive prompts for subjects and scenes aligned with the story,
annotating each scene's subjects for subsequent subject-consistent generation.
Second, DreamStory utilizes these detailed subject descriptions to create
portraits of the subjects, with these portraits and their corresponding textual
information serving as multimodal anchors (guidance). Finally, the MSD uses
these multimodal anchors to generate story scenes with consistent
multi-subject. Specifically, the MSD includes Masked Mutual Self-Attention
(MMSA) and Masked Mutual Cross-Attention (MMCA) modules. MMSA and MMCA modules
ensure appearance and semantic consistency with reference images and text,
respectively. Both modules employ masking mechanisms to prevent subject
blending. To validate our approach and promote progress in story visualization,
we established a benchmark, DS-500, which can assess the overall performance of
the story visualization framework, subject-identification accuracy, and the
consistency of the generation model. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of DreamStory in both subjective and objective evaluations.

for children. The distinctive feature of FairyLandAI is its dual capability: it
not only generates stories that are engaging, age-appropriate, and reflective
of various traditions but also autonomously produces imaginative prompts
suitable for advanced image generation tools like GenAI and Dalle-3, thereby
enriching the storytelling experience. FairyLandAI is expertly tailored to
resonate with the imaginative worlds of children, providing narratives that are
both educational and entertaining and in alignment with the moral values
inherent in different ages. Its unique strength lies in customizing stories to
match individual children's preferences and cultural backgrounds, heralding a
new era in personalized storytelling. Further, its integration with image
generation technology offers a comprehensive narrative experience that
stimulates both verbal and visual creativity. Empirical evaluations of
FairyLandAI demonstrate its effectiveness in crafting captivating stories for
children, which not only entertain but also embody the values and teachings of
diverse traditions. This model serves as an invaluable tool for parents and
educators, supporting them in imparting meaningful moral lessons through

for simulating ordinary individuals. Such an oversight limits the potential for
advancements in digital human clones and non-player characters in video games.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ECHO, an evaluative framework inspired by the
Turing test. This framework engages the acquaintances of the target individuals
to distinguish between human and machine-generated responses. Notably, our
framework focuses on emulating average individuals rather than historical or
fictional figures, presenting a unique advantage to apply the Turing Test. We
evaluated three role-playing LLMs using ECHO, with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 serving as
foundational models, alongside the online application GPTs from OpenAI. Our
results demonstrate that GPT-4 more effectively deceives human evaluators, and
GPTs achieves a leading success rate of 48.3%. Furthermore, we investigated
whether LLMs could discern between human-generated and machine-generated texts.
While GPT-4 can identify differences, it could not determine which texts were
human-produced. Our code and results of reproducing the role-playing LLMs are
made publicly available via https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/ECHO.",2024-04-22

Interaction with a honeyfile reveals the presence of an intruder, and can
provide insights into their goals and intentions. Their practical use, however,
is limited by the time, cost and effort associated with manually creating
realistic content. The introduction of large language models has made
high-quality text generation accessible, but honeyfiles contain a variety of
content including charts, tables and images. This content needs to be plausible
and realistic, as well as semantically consistent both within honeyfiles and
with the real documents they mimic, to successfully deceive an intruder.
  In this paper, we focus on an important component of the honeyfile content
generation problem: document charts. Charts are ubiquitous in corporate
documents and are commonly used to communicate quantitative and scientific
data. Existing image generation models, such as DALL-E, are rather prone to
generating charts with incomprehensible text and unconvincing data. We take a
multi-modal approach to this problem by combining two purpose-built generative
models: a multitask Transformer and a specialized multi-head autoencoder. The
Transformer generates realistic captions and plot text, while the autoencoder
generates the underlying tabular data for the plot.
  To advance the field of automated honeyplot generation, we also release a new
document-chart dataset and propose a novel metric Keyword Semantic Matching

performance against multiple large language models, including ChatGPT and GPT4.",2024-04-07

memorized in their parameters. It is also incomplete and largely incorrect.
LLMs operate at the level of word distributions, not at the level of verified

LLMs can be used as an alternative to human evaluation. We present the LLMs
with the exact same instructions, samples to be evaluated, and questions used
to conduct human evaluation, and then ask the LLMs to generate responses to
those questions; we dub this LLM evaluation. We use human evaluation and LLM
evaluation to evaluate the texts in two NLP tasks: open-ended story generation
and adversarial attacks. We show that the result of LLM evaluation is
consistent with the results obtained by expert human evaluation: the texts
rated higher by human experts are also rated higher by the LLMs. We also find
that the results of LLM evaluation are stable over different formatting of the
task instructions and the sampling algorithm used to generate the answer. We
are the first to show the potential of using LLMs to assess the quality of
texts and discuss the limitations and ethical considerations of LLM evaluation.",2023-05-03

that will be perceived by readers as the plot of a coherent story. Traditional
symbolic planners plan a story from a goal state and guarantee logical causal
plot coherence but rely on a library of hand-crafted actions with their
preconditions and effects. This closed world setting limits the length and
diversity of what symbolic planners can generate. On the other hand,
pre-trained neural language models can generate stories with great diversity,
while being generally incapable of ending a story in a specified manner and can
have trouble maintaining coherence. In this paper, we present an approach to
story plot generation that unifies causal planning with neural language models.
We propose to use commonsense knowledge extracted from large language models to
recursively expand a story plot in a backward chaining fashion. Specifically,
our system infers the preconditions for events in the story and then events
that will cause those conditions to become true. We performed automatic
evaluation to measure narrative coherence as indicated by the ability to answer
questions about whether different events in the story are causally related to
other events. Results indicate that our proposed method produces more coherent

example, language model pretraining often neglects the rich, freely-available
structures in textual data. In this thesis, we describe three lines of work
that seek to improve the training and evaluation of neural models using
naturally-occurring supervision.
  We first investigate self-supervised training losses to help enhance the
performance of pretrained language models for various NLP tasks. Specifically,
we alter the sentence prediction loss to make it better suited to other
pretraining losses and more challenging to solve. We design an intermediate
finetuning step that uses self-supervised training to promote models' ability
in cross-task generalization.
  Then we describe methods to leverage the structures in Wikipedia and
paraphrases. In particular, we propose training losses to exploit hyperlinks,
article structures, and article category graphs for entity-, discourse-,
entailment-related knowledge. We propose a framework that uses paraphrase pairs
to disentangle semantics and syntax in sentence representations. We extend the
framework for a novel generation task that controls the syntax of output text
with a sentential exemplar.
  Lastly, we discuss our work on tailoring textual resources for establishing
challenging evaluation tasks. We introduce three datasets by defining novel
tasks using various fan-contributed websites, including a long-form
data-to-text generation dataset, a screenplay summarization dataset, and a
long-form story generation dataset. These datasets have unique characteristics
offering challenges to future work in their respective task settings.",2022-07-21

of the method is to shift the output distribution of the autoregressive model
according to the output distribution of the autoencoding model in order to
ensure a coherent transition of the narrative in the text towards the guide
phrase, which can contain single words or collocations. The autoencoding model,
which is able to take into account the left and right contexts of the token,
""tells"" the autoregressive model which tokens are the most and least logical at

We suggest improvements to the standard protocol to make it more theoretically

reliable automatic evaluation metrics becomes an increasingly imperative issue
that hinders the fast development of story generation. According to conducted
researches in this regard, learnable evaluation metrics have promised more
accurate assessments by having higher correlations with human judgments. A
critical bottleneck of obtaining a reliable learnable evaluation metric is the
lack of high-quality training data for classifiers to efficiently distinguish
plausible and implausible machine-generated stories. Previous works relied on
\textit{heuristically manipulated} plausible examples to mimic possible system
drawbacks such as repetition, contradiction, or irrelevant content in the text
level, which can be \textit{unnatural} and \textit{oversimplify} the
characteristics of implausible machine-generated stories. We propose to tackle
these issues by generating a more comprehensive set of implausible stories
using {\em plots}, which are structured representations of controllable factors
used to generate stories. Since these plots are compact and structured, it is
easier to manipulate them to generate text with targeted undesirable
properties, while at the same time maintain the grammatical correctness and
naturalness of the generated sentences. To improve the quality of generated
implausible stories, we further apply the adversarial filtering procedure
presented by \citet{zellers2018swag} to select a more nuanced set of
implausible texts. Experiments show that the evaluation metrics trained on our

semantic frames that will occur in the next 10, 100, or even 1,000 sentences in
a running story. Prior work focused on predicting the immediate future of a
story, such as one to a few sentences ahead. However, when novelists write long
stories, generating a few sentences is not enough to help them gain high-level
insight to develop the follow-up story. In this paper, we formulate a long
story as a sequence of ""story blocks,"" where each block contains a fixed number
of sentences (e.g., 10, 100, or 200). This formulation allows us to predict the
follow-up story arc beyond the scope of a few sentences. We represent a story
block using the term frequencies (TF) of semantic frames in it, normalized by
each frame's inverse document frequency (IDF). We conduct semantic frame
forecast experiments on 4,794 books from the Bookcorpus and 7,962 scientific
abstracts from CODA-19, with block sizes ranging from 5 to 1,000 sentences. The
results show that automated models can forecast the follow-up story blocks
better than the random, prior, and replay baselines, indicating the task's
feasibility. We also learn that the models using the frame representation as
features outperform all the existing approaches when the block size is over 150

On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization,2020-05-02 00:09:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00661v1,"Joshua Maynez, Shashi Narayan, Bernd Bohnet, Ryan McDonald",cs.CL,story,"It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate
decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like
responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation.
In this paper we have analyzed limitations of these models for abstractive
document summarization and found that these models are highly prone to
hallucinate content that is unfaithful to the input document. We conducted a
large scale human evaluation of several neural abstractive summarization
systems to better understand the types of hallucinations they produce. Our
human annotators found substantial amounts of hallucinated content in all model
generated summaries. However, our analysis does show that pretrained models are
better summarizers not only in terms of raw metrics, i.e., ROUGE, but also in
generating faithful and factual summaries as evaluated by humans. Furthermore,
we show that textual entailment measures better correlate with faithfulness
than standard metrics, potentially leading the way to automatic evaluation
metrics as well as training and decoding criteria.",2020-05-02
Sparse Text Generation,2020-04-06 13:09:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02644v3,"Pedro Henrique Martins, Zita Marinho, André F. T. Martins",cs.CL,story,"Current state-of-the-art text generators build on powerful language models
such as GPT-2, achieving impressive performance. However, to avoid degenerate
text, they require sampling from a modified softmax, via temperature parameters
or ad-hoc truncation techniques, as in top-$k$ or nucleus sampling. This
creates a mismatch between training and testing conditions. In this paper, we
use the recently introduced entmax transformation to train and sample from a
natively sparse language model, avoiding this mismatch. The result is a text
generator with favorable performance in terms of fluency and consistency, fewer
repetitions, and n-gram diversity closer to human text. In order to evaluate
our model, we propose three new metrics for comparing sparse or truncated
distributions: $\epsilon$-perplexity, sparsemax score, and Jensen-Shannon
divergence. Human-evaluated experiments in story completion and dialogue
generation show that entmax sampling leads to more engaging and coherent
stories and conversations.",2020-04-06
Semantics of the Unwritten,2020-04-05 16:55:09+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02251v1,"He Bai, Peng Shi, Jimmy Lin, Luchen Tan, Kun Xiong, Wen Gao, Jie Liu, Ming Li",cs.CL,story,"The semantics of a text is manifested not only by what is read, but also by
what is not read. In this article, we will study how those implicit ""not read""
information such as end-of-paragraph (EOP) and end-of-sequence (EOS) affect the
quality of text generation. Transformer-based pretrained language models (LMs)
have demonstrated the ability to generate long continuations with good quality.
This model gives us a platform for the first time to demonstrate that paragraph
layouts and text endings are also important components of human writing.
Specifically, we find that pretrained LMs can generate better continuations by
learning to generate the end of the paragraph (EOP) in the fine-tuning stage.
Experimental results on English story generation show that EOP can lead to
higher BLEU score and lower EOS perplexity. To further investigate the
relationship between text ending and EOP, we conduct experiments with a
self-collected Chinese essay dataset on Chinese-GPT2, a character level LM
without paragraph breaker or EOS during pre-training. Experimental results show
that the Chinese GPT2 can generate better essay endings with paragraph
information. Experiments on both English stories and Chinese essays demonstrate
that learning to end paragraphs can benefit the continuation generation with
pretrained LMs.",2020-04-05
Counterfactual Story Reasoning and Generation,2019-09-09 18:08:35+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04076v2,"Lianhui Qin, Antoine Bosselut, Ari Holtzman, Chandra Bhagavatula, Elizabeth Clark, Yejin Choi","cs.CL, cs.AI",story,"Counterfactual reasoning requires predicting how alternative events, contrary
to what actually happened, might have resulted in different outcomes. Despite
being considered a necessary component of AI-complete systems, few resources
have been developed for evaluating counterfactual reasoning in narratives.
  In this paper, we propose Counterfactual Story Rewriting: given an original
story and an intervening counterfactual event, the task is to minimally revise
the story to make it compatible with the given counterfactual event. Solving
this task will require deep understanding of causal narrative chains and
counterfactual invariance, and integration of such story reasoning capabilities
into conditional language generation models.
  We present TimeTravel, a new dataset of 29,849 counterfactual rewritings,
each with the original story, a counterfactual event, and human-generated
revision of the original story compatible with the counterfactual event.
Additionally, we include 80,115 counterfactual ""branches"" without a rewritten
storyline to support future work on semi- or un-supervised approaches to
counterfactual story rewriting.
  Finally, we evaluate the counterfactual rewriting capacities of several
competitive baselines based on pretrained language models, and assess whether
common overlap and model-based automatic metrics for text generation correlate
well with human scores for counterfactual rewriting.",2019-09-09

generative models have shown promising results for various text generation
problems. Sequence to Sequence (Seq2Seq) models are typically trained to

context of a story, multiple endings are possible. Seq2Seq models tend to
ignore the context and generate generic and dull responses. Very few works have
studied generating diverse and interesting story endings for a given story
context. In this paper, we propose models which generate more diverse and
interesting outputs by 1) training models to focus attention on important
keyphrases of the story, and 2) promoting generation of non-generic words. We
show that the combination of the two leads to more diverse and interesting
endings.",2019-07-18

both fits its context and is grounded in a content-rich external textual source

current language models generate word by word from left to right. We explore
coarse-to-fine models for creating narrative texts of several hundred words,
and introduce new models which decompose stories by abstracting over actions
and entities. The model first generates the predicate-argument structure of the
text, where different mentions of the same entity are marked with placeholder
tokens. It then generates a surface realization of the predicate-argument
structure, and finally replaces the entity placeholders with context-sensitive
names and references. Human judges prefer the stories from our models to a wide
range of previous approaches to hierarchical text generation. Extensive
analysis shows that our methods can help improve the diversity and coherence of
events and entities in generated stories.",2019-02-04

numbers of a certain word appearing in the text generate the uneven
Benford-like distribution of leading numbers. Excluding the most popular words
essentially improves the correlation of actual textual data with the Zipfian
distribution, whereas the Benford distribution of leading numbers (arising from
the overall amount of a certain word) is insensitive to the same elimination
procedure. The calculated values of the moduli of slopes of double
logarithmical plots for artificial languages (C++, Java) are markedly larger

generation from independent descriptions, describing a scene or an event.
Towards this, we explore along two popular text-generation paradigms -- (1)
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), posing story generation as a translation
problem and (2) Deep Learning, posing story generation as a sequence to
sequence learning problem. In SMT, we chose two popular methods such as phrase
based SMT (PB-SMT) and syntax based SMT (SYNTAX-SMT) to `translate' the
incoherent input text into stories. We then implement a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that encodes sequence of variable length input
descriptions to corresponding latent representations and decodes them to
produce well formed comprehensive story like summaries. The efficacy of the
suggested approaches is demonstrated on a publicly available dataset with the
help of popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics.",2017-07-18

students stay more engaged by quickly transforming all of their homework
assignments to the theme of their favorite movie without changing the math
concepts that are being taught. Our rewriting method uses a two-stage decoding
process, which proposes new words from the target theme and scores the
resulting stories according to a number of factors defining aspects of
syntactic, semantic, and thematic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that the
final stories typically represent the new theme well while still testing the
original math concepts, outperforming a number of baselines. We also release a
