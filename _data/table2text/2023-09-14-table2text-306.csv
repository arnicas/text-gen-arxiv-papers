"CATfOOD: Counterfactual Augmented Training for Improving Out-of-Domain
  Performance and Calibration",2023-09-14 16:16:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07822v1,"Rachneet Sachdeva, Martin Tutek, Iryna Gurevych",cs.CL,table2text,"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable
capabilities at scale, particularly at generating text conditioned on a prompt.
In our work, we investigate the use of LLMs to augment training data of small
language models~(SLMs) with automatically generated counterfactual~(CF)
instances -- i.e. minimally altered inputs -- in order to improve
out-of-domain~(OOD) performance of SLMs in the extractive question
answering~(QA) setup. We show that, across various LLM generators, such data
augmentation consistently enhances OOD performance and improves model
calibration for both confidence-based and rationale-augmented calibrator
models. Furthermore, these performance improvements correlate with higher
diversity of CF instances in terms of their surface form and semantic content.
Finally, we show that CF augmented models which are easier to calibrate also
exhibit much lower entropy when assigning importance, indicating that
rationale-augmented calibrators prefer concise explanations.",2023-09-14
Semantic reconstruction of continuous language from MEG signals,2023-09-14 13:19:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07701v1,"Bo Wang, Xiran Xu, Longxiang Zhang, Boda Xiao, Xihong Wu, Jing Chen","cs.HC, eess.SP, q-bio.NC",table2text,"Decoding language from neural signals holds considerable theoretical and
practical importance. Previous research has indicated the feasibility of
decoding text or speech from invasive neural signals. However, when using
non-invasive neural signals, significant challenges are encountered due to
their low quality. In this study, we proposed a data-driven approach for
decoding semantic of language from Magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals
recorded while subjects were listening to continuous speech. First, a
multi-subject decoding model was trained using contrastive learning to
reconstruct continuous word embeddings from MEG data. Subsequently, a beam
search algorithm was adopted to generate text sequences based on the
reconstructed word embeddings. Given a candidate sentence in the beam, a
language model was used to predict the subsequent words. The word embeddings of
the subsequent words were correlated with the reconstructed word embedding.
These correlations were then used as a measure of the probability for the next
word. The results showed that the proposed continuous word embedding model can
effectively leverage both subject-specific and subject-shared information.
Additionally, the decoded text exhibited significant similarity to the target
text, with an average BERTScore of 0.816, a score comparable to that in the
previous fMRI study.",2023-09-14
Auto-Regressive Next-Token Predictors are Universal Learners,2023-09-13 14:15:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06979v1,Eran Malach,"cs.LG, cs.CL",table2text,"Large language models display remarkable capabilities in logical and

introduce a new complexity measure -- length complexity -- which measures the
number of intermediate tokens in a CoT sequence required to approximate some
target function, and analyze the interplay between length complexity and other
notions of complexity. Finally, we show experimentally that simple next-token
predictors, such as linear networks and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs),
display non-trivial performance on text generation and arithmetic tasks. Our
results demonstrate that the power of language models can be attributed, to a
great extent, to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, and not
necessarily to a particular choice of architecture.",2023-09-13

proposed using hyperbolic and spherical spaces with constant curvature, or

performance. However, little attention has been given to the problem of
automatically identifying the optimal latent geometry for the downstream task.
We mathematically define this novel formulation and coin it as neural latent
geometry search (NLGS). More specifically, we introduce a principled method
that searches for a latent geometry composed of a product of constant curvature
model spaces with minimal query evaluations. To accomplish this, we propose a
novel notion of distance between candidate latent geometries based on the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance from metric geometry. In order to compute the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance, we introduce a mapping function that enables the
comparison of different manifolds by embedding them in a common
high-dimensional ambient space. Finally, we design a graph search space based
on the calculated distances between candidate manifolds and use Bayesian
optimization to search for the optimal latent geometry in a query-efficient

tasks via task prompting. And their performance can be further improved by
appending task demonstrations to the head of the prompt. And usually, a better

to write the demonstrations can be cumbersome. As a simple yet cost-effective
workaround, this paper proposes a novel method called EPA (\textbf{E}asy

augmenting prompts via demonstrations, we name it EPA as the name EDA is

effectively minimizes user efforts in writing demonstrations while improving
the model performance at the same time. EPA achieves these goals by
automatically augmenting the demonstrations with multiple sources/targets,
where each of them paraphrases each other. This is well motivated as augmenting
data via paraphrasing effectively improves neural language models. EPA thus
employs paraphrasing as an augmentation method for in-context learning.
Extensive experiments indicate that EPA effectively improves both NLU and NLG

translating tens of languages.\footnote{Code and data will be released upon

PromptTTS 2: Describing and Generating Voices with Text Prompt,2023-09-05 14:45:27+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02285v1,"Yichong Leng, Zhifang Guo, Kai Shen, Xu Tan, Zeqian Ju, Yanqing Liu, Yufei Liu, Dongchao Yang, Leying Zhang, Kaitao Song, Lei He, Xiang-Yang Li, Sheng Zhao, Tao Qin, Jiang Bian","eess.AS, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.SD",table2text,"Speech conveys more information than just text, as the same word can be
uttered in various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to
traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference
speech) for voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more
user-friendly since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all.
TTS approaches based on the text prompt face two challenges: 1) the one-to-many
problem, where not all details about voice variability can be described in the
text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt datasets, where
vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write text prompt for
speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address these challenges with
a variation network to provide variability information of voice not captured by
text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize the large language
models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts. Specifically, the variation
network predicts the representation extracted from the reference speech (which
contains full information about voice) based on the text prompt representation.
For the prompt generation pipeline, it generates text prompts for speech with a
speech understanding model to recognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed)
from speech and a large language model to formulate text prompt based on the
recognition results. Experiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset
demonstrate that compared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices
more consistent with text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice
variability, thereby offering users more choices on voice generation.
Additionally, the prompt generation pipeline produces high-quality prompts,
eliminating the large labeling cost. The demo page of PromptTTS 2 is available

speech recognition system are used as inputs for LLMs, which limits their
potential in modeling alignment between speech and text. The other is an
end-to-end approach that relies on speech instruction data, which is very
difficult to collect in large quantities. In this paper, we address these

Pre-training via behavior alignment of continuation writing. We achieve this by
learning a lightweight modality adapter between a frozen speech encoder and an
LLM, ensuring that the LLM exhibits the same generation behavior regardless of
the modality of input: a speech segment or its transcript. The training process
can be divided into two steps. The first step prompts an LLM to generate texts
with speech transcripts as prefixes, obtaining text continuations. In the
second step, these continuations are used as supervised signals to train the
modality adapter in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that this
straightforward process can extend the capabilities of LLMs to speech, enabling

Random Word Data Augmentation with CLIP for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection,2023-08-22 01:55:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11119v1,Masato Tamura,"cs.CV, cs.LG",table2text,"This paper presents a novel method that leverages a visual-language model,
CLIP, as a data source for zero-shot anomaly detection. Tremendous efforts have
been put towards developing anomaly detectors due to their potential industrial
applications. Considering the difficulty in acquiring various anomalous samples
for training, most existing methods train models with only normal samples and
measure discrepancies from the distribution of normal samples during inference,
which requires training a model for each object category. The problem of this
inefficient training requirement has been tackled by designing a CLIP-based
anomaly detector that applies prompt-guided classification to each part of an
image in a sliding window manner. However, the method still suffers from the
labor of careful prompt ensembling with known object categories. To overcome
the issues above, we propose leveraging CLIP as a data source for training. Our
method generates text embeddings with the text encoder in CLIP with typical
prompts that include words of normal and anomaly. In addition to these words,
we insert several randomly generated words into prompts, which enables the
encoder to generate a diverse set of normal and anomalous samples. Using the
generated embeddings as training data, a feed-forward neural network learns to
extract features of normal and anomaly from CLIP's embeddings, and as a result,
a category-agnostic anomaly detector can be obtained without any training
images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves

and GPT-3.5, some prominent language models, to better understand its
implications. Through a comprehensive literature review, the study examines
existing research on gender bias in AI language models and identifies gaps in
the current knowledge. The methodology involves collecting and preprocessing
data from GPT-2 and GPT-3.5, and employing in-depth quantitative analysis
techniques to evaluate gender bias in the generated text. The findings shed
light on gendered word associations, language usage, and biased narratives
present in the outputs of these Large Language Models. The discussion explores
the ethical implications of gender bias and its potential consequences on
social perceptions and marginalized communities. Additionally, the paper
presents strategies for reducing gender bias in LLMs, including algorithmic
approaches and data augmentation techniques. The research highlights the
importance of interdisciplinary collaborations and the role of sociological
studies in mitigating gender bias in AI models. By addressing these issues, we

first examine two approaches to diversify text generation: 1) logit
suppression, which minimizes the generation of languages that have already been
frequently generated, and 2) temperature sampling, which flattens the token
sampling probability. We found that diversification approaches can increase
data diversity but often at the cost of data accuracy (i.e., text and labels
being appropriate for the target domain). To address this issue, we examined
two human interventions, 1) label replacement (LR), correcting misaligned
labels, and 2) out-of-scope filtering (OOSF), removing instances that are out
of the user's domain of interest or to which no considered label applies. With
oracle studies, we found that LR increases the absolute accuracy of models
trained with diversified datasets by 14.4%. Moreover, we found that some models

Hence, we propose $\lambda$-\textit{equitune} that averages the features using
\textit{importance weights}, $\lambda$s. These weights are learned directly
from the data using a small neural network, leading to excellent zero-shot and

compressing them, which is crucial for real-world applications serving millions
of users. We focus on Knowledge Distillation (KD) techniques, in which a small
student model learns to imitate a large teacher model, allowing to transfer
knowledge from the teacher to the student. In contrast to much of the previous
work, our goal is to optimize the model for a specific NLG task and a specific
dataset. Typically, in real-world applications, in addition to labeled data
there is abundant unlabeled task-specific data, which is crucial for attaining
high compression rates via KD. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of
task-specific KD techniques for various NLG tasks under realistic assumptions.
We discuss the special characteristics of NLG distillation and particularly the
exposure bias problem. Following, we derive a family of Pseudo-Target (PT)
augmentation methods, substantially extending prior work on sequence-level KD.
We propose the Joint-Teaching method for NLG distillation, which applies
word-level KD to multiple PTs generated by both the teacher and the student.

another model, called a guardrail model, to verify that the agent output aligns

performances on a variety of NLP tasks, its performance on NER is still
significantly below supervised baselines. This is due to the gap between the
two tasks the NER and LLMs: the former is a sequence labeling task in nature
while the latter is a text-generation model.
  In this paper, we propose GPT-NER to resolve this issue. GPT-NER bridges the
gap by transforming the sequence labeling task to a generation task that can be
easily adapted by LLMs e.g., the task of finding location entities in the input
text ""Columbus is a city"" is transformed to generate the text sequence
""@@Columbus## is a city"", where special tokens @@## marks the entity to
extract. To efficiently address the ""hallucination"" issue of LLMs, where LLMs
have a strong inclination to over-confidently label NULL inputs as entities, we
propose a self-verification strategy by prompting LLMs to ask itself whether
the extracted entities belong to a labeled entity tag.
  We conduct experiments on five widely adopted NER datasets, and GPT-NER
achieves comparable performances to fully supervised baselines, which is the
first time as far as we are concerned. More importantly, we find that GPT-NER
exhibits a greater ability in the low-resource and few-shot setups, when the

Measuring and Manipulating Knowledge Representations in Language Models,2023-04-03 06:24:10+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00740v1,"Evan Hernandez, Belinda Z. Li, Jacob Andreas",cs.CL,table2text,"Neural language models (LMs) represent facts about the world described by
text. Sometimes these facts derive from training data (in most LMs, a
representation of the word banana encodes the fact that bananas are fruits).
Sometimes facts derive from input text itself (a representation of the sentence
""I poured out the bottle"" encodes the fact that the bottle became empty). Tools
for inspecting and modifying LM fact representations would be useful almost
everywhere LMs are used: making it possible to update them when the world
changes, to localize and remove sources of bias, and to identify errors in
generated text. We describe REMEDI, an approach for querying and modifying
factual knowledge in LMs. REMEDI learns a map from textual queries to fact
encodings in an LM's internal representation system. These encodings can be
used as knowledge editors: by adding them to LM hidden representations, we can
modify downstream generation to be consistent with new facts. REMEDI encodings
can also be used as model probes: by comparing them to LM representations, we
can ascertain what properties LMs attribute to mentioned entities, and predict
when they will generate outputs that conflict with background knowledge or
input text. REMEDI thus links work on probing, prompting, and model editing,
and offers steps toward general tools for fine-grained inspection and control

Decoding the End-to-end Writing Trajectory in Scholarly Manuscripts,2023-03-31 20:33:03+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00121v1,"Ryan Koo, Anna Martin, Linghe Wang, Dongyeop Kang","cs.CL, cs.HC",table2text,"Scholarly writing presents a complex space that generally follows a
methodical procedure to plan and produce both rationally sound and creative
compositions. Recent works involving large language models (LLM) demonstrate
considerable success in text generation and revision tasks; however, LLMs still
struggle to provide structural and creative feedback on the document level that
is crucial to academic writing. In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy
that categorizes scholarly writing behaviors according to intention, writer
actions, and the information types of the written data. We also provide
ManuScript, an original dataset annotated with a simplified version of our
taxonomy to show writer actions and the intentions behind them. Motivated by
cognitive writing theory, our taxonomy for scientific papers includes three
levels of categorization in order to trace the general writing flow and
identify the distinct writer activities embedded within each higher-level
process. ManuScript intends to provide a complete picture of the scholarly
writing process by capturing the linearity and non-linearity of writing
trajectory, such that writing assistants can provide stronger feedback and

Assessing Language Model Deployment with Risk Cards,2023-03-31 16:45:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18190v1,"Leon Derczynski, Hannah Rose Kirk, Vidhisha Balachandran, Sachin Kumar, Yulia Tsvetkov, M. R. Leiser, Saif Mohammad",cs.CL,table2text,"This paper introduces RiskCards, a framework for structured assessment and
documentation of risks associated with an application of language models. As
with all language, text generated by language models can be harmful, or used to
bring about harm. Automating language generation adds both an element of scale
and also more subtle or emergent undesirable tendencies to the generated text.
Prior work establishes a wide variety of language model harms to many different
actors: existing taxonomies identify categories of harms posed by language
models; benchmarks establish automated tests of these harms; and documentation
standards for models, tasks and datasets encourage transparent reporting.
However, there is no risk-centric framework for documenting the complexity of a
landscape in which some risks are shared across models and contexts, while
others are specific, and where certain conditions may be required for risks to
manifest as harms. RiskCards address this methodological gap by providing a
generic framework for assessing the use of a given language model in a given
scenario. Each RiskCard makes clear the routes for the risk to manifest harm,
their placement in harm taxonomies, and example prompt-output pairs. While
RiskCards are designed to be open-source, dynamic and participatory, we present
a ""starter set"" of RiskCards taken from a broad literature survey, each of
which details a concrete risk presentation. Language model RiskCards initiate a
community knowledge base which permits the mapping of risks and harms to a
specific model or its application scenario, ultimately contributing to a
better, safer and shared understanding of the risk landscape.",2023-03-31

improvement in the quality of outputs of large language models (LLMs) like GPT.
Given that both GPT-3 and GPT-4 were trained on large quantities of
human-generated text, we might ask to what extent their outputs reflect
patterns of human thinking, both for correct and incorrect cases. The Erotetic
Theory of Reason (ETR) provides a symbolic generative model of both human
success and failure in thinking, across propositional, quantified, and
probabilistic reasoning, as well as decision-making. We presented GPT-3,
GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 with 61 central inference and judgment problems from a
recent book-length presentation of ETR, consisting of experimentally verified
data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR,
with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the
ETR61 benchmark). ETR61 includes classics like Wason's card task, illusory
inferences, the decoy effect, and opportunity-cost neglect, among others. GPT-3
showed evidence of ETR-predicted outputs for 59% of these examples, rising to
77% in GPT-3.5 and 75% in GPT-4. Remarkably, the production of human-like
fallacious judgments increased from 18% in GPT-3 to 33% in GPT-3.5 and 34% in
GPT-4. This suggests that larger and more advanced LLMs may develop a tendency
toward more human-like mistakes, as relevant thought patterns are inherent in
human-produced training data. According to ETR, the same fundamental patterns
are involved both in successful and unsuccessful ordinary reasoning, so that
the ""bad"" cases could paradoxically be learned from the ""good"" cases. We
further present preliminary evidence that ETR-inspired prompt engineering could
reduce instances of these mistakes.",2023-03-30

is a caveat: If the model produces output that is similar to copyrighted data,
particularly in scenarios that affect the market of that data, fair use may no
longer apply to the output of the model. In this work, we emphasize that fair
use is not guaranteed, and additional work may be necessary to keep model
development and deployment squarely in the realm of fair use. First, we survey
the potential risks of developing and deploying foundation models based on
copyrighted content. We review relevant U.S. case law, drawing parallels to
existing and potential applications for generating text, source code, and
visual art. Experiments confirm that popular foundation models can generate
content considerably similar to copyrighted material. Second, we discuss
technical mitigations that can help foundation models stay in line with fair
use. We argue that more research is needed to align mitigation strategies with
the current state of the law. Lastly, we suggest that the law and technical
mitigations should co-evolve. For example, coupled with other policy
mechanisms, the law could more explicitly consider safe harbors when strong
technical tools are used to mitigate infringement harms. This co-evolution may
help strike a balance between intellectual property and innovation, which
speaks to the original goal of fair use. But we emphasize that the strategies
we describe here are not a panacea and more work is needed to develop policies

Self-Attention (IRSA) in one (or a combination) of three ways: 1) Using strong

Explicitly forbidding (skipping) self-attention to parts of the generated text.
On a dynamic program execution, IRSA leads to larger accuracy gains than
replacing the model with the much more powerful GPT-4. IRSA has promising
applications in education, as the prompts and responses resemble student

implications for evaluating LLMs, which typically target the in-context

train an 11B parameter paraphrase generation model (DIPPER) that can paraphrase
paragraphs, optionally leveraging surrounding text (e.g., user-written prompts)

DetectGPT, and OpenAI's text classifier. For example, DIPPER drops the
detection accuracy of DetectGPT from 70.3% to 4.6% (at a constant false
positive rate of 1%), without appreciably modifying the input semantics. To
increase the robustness of AI-generated text detection to paraphrase attacks,
we introduce a simple defense that relies on retrieving semantically-similar
generations and must be maintained by a language model API provider. Given a
candidate text, our algorithm searches a database of sequences previously
generated by the API, looking for sequences that match the candidate text

fine-tuned on task-specific data (e.g., natural language generation, text

usually have an input-length limitation caused by hardware constraints. This
limitation applies to many transformers, including the well-known bidirectional

examined BERT's attention assignment mechanism, focusing on two questions: (1)
How can attention be employed to reduce input length? (2) How can attention be
used as a control mechanism for conditional text generation? We investigated
these questions in the context of a text classification task. We discovered
that BERT's early layers assign more critical attention scores for text
classification tasks compared to later layers. We demonstrated that the first
layer's attention sums could be used to filter tokens in a given sequence,
considerably decreasing the input length while maintaining good test accuracy.
We also applied filtering, which uses a compute-efficient semantic similarities
algorithm, and discovered that retaining approximately 6\% of the original

texts. It is one of the most fundamental tasks in natural language processing

pre-trained language models (PLMs) cover broader concepts and can be used in
both causal sequential modeling and fine-tuning for downstream applications.
PLMs have their own training paradigms (usually self-supervised) and serve as
foundation models in modern NLP systems. This overview paper provides an
introduction to both CLMs and PLMs from five aspects, i.e., linguistic units,

existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the
encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a
simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a
lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient
and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,
easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require
end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the
text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix
embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but
at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.
The modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models
that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix
embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We
project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the
projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the
projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality
descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap
outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods

the average user. Question answering (QA) systems assist by translating natural
language questions to SPARQL. Existing QA systems are typically based on
application-specific human-curated rules, or require prior information,
expensive pre-processing and model adaptation for each targeted KG. Therefore,
they are hard to generalize to a broad set of applications and KGs.
  In this paper, we propose KGQAn, a universal QA system that does not need to
be tailored to each target KG. Instead of curated rules, KGQAn introduces a
novel formalization of question understanding as a text generation problem to
convert a question into an intermediate abstract representation via a neural
sequence-to-sequence model. We also develop a just-in-time linker that maps at
query time the abstract representation to a SPARQL query for a specific KG,
using only the publicly accessible APIs and the existing indices of the RDF

estimation (MLE) as the optimizing method. From a distributional view, MLE in
fact minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the distribution

to distribute non-zero (sometimes large) probability mass to all training
samples regardless of their quality. Moreover, in the attempt to cover the
low-probability regions in the data distribution, the model systematically
overestimates the probability of corrupted text sequences, which we conjecture
is one of the main reasons for text degeneration during autoregressive
decoding. To remedy this problem, we leverage the total variation distance

enables us to fully use the large amounts of unlabelled domain-specific

employed to reduce resource usage. However, their application to and efficacy
for generative language models is heavily under-explored. In this paper we
conduct an comprehensive evaluation of common structured pruning methods,
including magnitude, random, and movement pruning on the feed-forward layers in
GPT-type models. Unexpectedly, random pruning results in performance that is
comparable to the best established methods, across multiple natural language
generation tasks. To understand these results, we provide a framework for
measuring neuron-level redundancy of models pruned by different methods, and
discover that established structured pruning methods do not take into account
the distinctiveness of neurons, leaving behind excess redundancies. In view of
this, we introduce Globally Unique Movement (GUM) to improve the uniqueness of
neurons in pruned models. We then discuss the effects of our techniques on
different redundancy metrics to explain the improved performance.",2023-02-07

part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, constituency and dependency
parsing, to develop efficient exploitation methods costing zero extra

Earlier, a framework named DisCoCirc was sketched that (1) is compositional and
distributional (a.k.a. vectorial); (2) applies to general text; (3) captures
linguistic `connections' between meanings (cf. grammar) (4) updates word
meanings as text progresses; (5) structures sentence types; (6) accommodates
ambiguity. Here, we realise DisCoCirc for a substantial fragment of English.
  When passing to DisCoCirc's text circuits, some `grammatical bureaucracy' is
eliminated, that is, DisCoCirc displays a significant degree of (7) inter- and
intra-language independence. That is, e.g., independence from word-order
conventions that differ across languages, and independence from choices like
many short sentences vs. few long sentences. This inter-language independence
means our text circuits should carry over to other languages, unlike the
language-specific typings of categorial grammars. Hence, text circuits are a
lean structure for the `actual substance of text', that is, the inner-workings
of meanings within text across several layers of expressiveness (cf. words,
sentences, text), and may capture that what is truly universal beneath grammar.
The elimination of grammatical bureaucracy also explains why DisCoCirc: (8)
applies beyond language, e.g. to spatial, visual and other cognitive modes.
While humans could not verbally communicate in terms of text circuits, machines
can.
  We first define a `hybrid grammar' for a fragment of English, i.e. a
purpose-built, minimal grammatical formalism needed to obtain text circuits. We
then detail a translation process such that all text generated by this grammar
yields a text circuit. Conversely, for any text circuit obtained by freely
composing the generators, there exists a text (with hybrid grammar) that gives
rise to it. Hence: (9) text circuits are generative for text.",2023-01-25

effective and efficient learning on the source-target mapping. In this paper,
we present a learning paradigm called regeneration learning for data
generation, which first generates Y' (an abstraction/representation of Y) from
X and then generates Y from Y'. During training, Y' is obtained from Y through
either handcrafted rules or self-supervised learning and is used to learn
X-->Y' and Y'-->Y. Regeneration learning extends the concept of representation
learning to data generation tasks, and can be regarded as a counterpart of
traditional representation learning, since 1) regeneration learning handles the
abstraction (Y') of the target data Y for data generation while traditional
representation learning handles the abstraction (X') of source data X for data
understanding; 2) both the processes of Y'-->Y in regeneration learning and
X-->X' in representation learning can be learned in a self-supervised way
(e.g., pre-training); 3) both the mappings from X to Y' in regeneration
learning and from X' to Y in representation learning are simpler than the

constraints to search the domain-related databases. The large-scale
task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state

effective pretraining method to alleviate this problem, which consists of two
pretraining phases. The first phase is to pretrain on large-scale contextual
text data, where the structured information of the text is extracted by the
information extracting tool. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method

may involve different modalities and be sequentially correlated. To model such
human capabilities, in this paper, we define and solve a novel AI creation
problem based on human experiences. More specifically, we study how to generate
texts based on sequential multi-modal information. Compared with the previous
works, this task is much more difficult because the designed model has to well
understand and adapt the semantics among different modalities and effectively
convert them into the output in a sequential manner. To alleviate these

optimization, we then propose a curriculum negative sampling strategy tailored

semantic information from textual data, and transmits it to each user. The
semantic information is modeled by a knowledge graph (KG) that consists of a
set of semantic triples. After receiving the semantic information, each user
recovers the original text using a graph-to-text generation model. To measure
the performance of the considered semantic communication framework, a metric of
semantic similarity (MSS) that jointly captures the semantic accuracy and
completeness of the recovered text is proposed. Due to wireless resource
limitations, the BS may not be able to transmit the entire semantic information
to each user and satisfy the transmission delay constraint. Hence, the BS must
select an appropriate resource block for each user as well as determine and
transmit part of the semantic information to the users. As such, we formulate
an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the total MSS by jointly
optimizing the resource allocation policy and determining the partial semantic
information to be transmitted. To solve this problem, a
proximal-policy-optimization-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
integrated with an attention network is proposed. The proposed algorithm can
evaluate the importance of each triple in the semantic information using an

adjust its learning rate thus ensuring convergence to a locally optimal

understanding machine learning models. Specifically, TalkToModel comprises
three key components: 1) a natural language interface for engaging in
dialogues, making understanding ML models highly accessible, 2) a dialogue
engine that adapts to any tabular model and dataset, interprets natural
language, maps it to appropriate operations (e.g., feature importance
explanations, counterfactual explanations, showing model errors), and generates
text responses, and 3) an execution component that run the operations and
ensures explanations are accurate. We carried out quantitative and human
subject evaluations of TalkToModel. We found the system understands user
questions on novel datasets and models with high accuracy, demonstrating the
system's capacity to generalize to new situations. In human evaluations, 73% of
healthcare workers (e.g., doctors and nurses) agreed they would use TalkToModel
over baseline point-and-click systems, and 84.6% of ML graduate students agreed

Can Language Models Make Fun?

of the most attractive parts. Producing natural language like humans using
computers, a.k.a, Natural Language Generation (NLG), has been widely used for
dialogue systems, chatbots, machine translation, as well as computer-aid
creation e.g., idea generations, scriptwriting. However, the humor aspect of
natural language is relatively under-investigated, especially in the age of
pre-trained language models. In this work, we aim to preliminarily test whether
NLG can generate humor as humans do. We build a new dataset consisting of
numerous digitized Chinese Comical Crosstalk scripts (called C$^3$ in short),
which is for a popular Chinese performing art called `Xiangsheng' since 1800s.
(For convenience for non-Chinese speakers, we called `crosstalk' for
`Xiangsheng' in this paper.) We benchmark various generation approaches
including training-from-scratch Seq2seq, fine-tuned middle-scale PLMs, and
large-scale PLMs (with and without fine-tuning). Moreover, we also conduct a
human assessment, showing that 1) large-scale pretraining largely improves
crosstalk generation quality; and 2) even the scripts generated from the best
PLM is far from what we expect, with only 65% quality of human-created
crosstalk. We conclude, humor generation could be largely improved using
large-scaled PLMs, but it is still in its infancy.

Language Generation). In this article, we introduce our framework for
generating the factual questions from unstructured text in the English
language. It uses a combination of traditional linguistic approaches based on
sentence patterns with several machine learning methods. We firstly obtain
lexical, syntactic and semantic information from an input text and we then
construct a hierarchical set of patterns for each sentence. The set of features
is extracted from the patterns and it is then used for automated learning of
new transformation rules. Our learning process is totally data-driven because
the transformation rules are obtained from a set of initial sentence-question
pairs. The advantages of this approach lie in a simple expansion of new
transformation rules which allows us to generate various types of questions and
also in the continuous improvement of the system by reinforcement learning. The
framework also includes a question evaluation module which estimates the
quality of generated questions. It serves as a filter for selecting the best
questions and eliminating incorrect ones or duplicates. We have performed
several experiments to evaluate the correctness of generated questions and we
have also compared our system with several state-of-the-art systems. Our
results indicate that the quality of generated questions outperforms the
state-of-the-art systems and our questions are also comparable to questions
created by humans. We have also created and published an interface with all
created datasets and evaluated questions, so it is possible to follow up on our
work.",2022-05-25
PLOG: Table-to-Logic Pretraining for Logical Table-to-Text Generation,2022-05-25 11:55:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12697v1,"Ao Liu, Haoyu Dong, Naoaki Okazaki, Shi Han, Dongmei Zhang",cs.CL,table2text,"Logical table-to-text generation is a task that involves generating logically
faithful sentences from tables, which requires models to derive logical level
facts from table records via logical inference. It raises a new challenge on
the logical-level content planning of table-to-text models. However, directly
learning the logical inference knowledge from table-text pairs is very
difficult for neural models because of the ambiguity of natural language and
the scarcity of parallel data. Hence even large-scale pre-trained language
models present low logical fidelity on logical table-to-text. In this work, we
propose a PLOG (Pretrained Logical Form Generator) framework to improve the
generation fidelity. Specifically, PLOG is first pretrained on a
table-to-logic-form generation (table-to-logic) task, then finetuned on
downstream table-to-text tasks. The formal definition of logical forms enables
us to collect large amount of accurate logical forms from tables without human
annotation. In addition, PLOG can learn logical inference from table-logic
pairs much more definitely than from table-text pairs. To evaluate our model,
we further collect a controlled logical table-to-text dataset CONTLOG based on
an existing dataset. On two benchmarks, LOGICNLG and CONTLOG, PLOG outperforms
strong baselines by a large margin on the logical fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness of table-to-logic pretraining.",2022-05-25
