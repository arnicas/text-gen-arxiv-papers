"Intermediate Training on Question Answering Datasets Improves Generative
  Data Augmentation",2022-05-25 09:28:21+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12604v1,"Dheeraj Mekala, Tu Vu, Jingbo Shang",cs.CL,table2text,"Manually annotating datasets requires domain experts to read through many
documents and carefully label them, which is often expensive. Recently,
pre-trained generative language models (GLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
abilities in generating text which motivates to leverage them for generative
data augmentation. We improve generative data augmentation by formulating the
data generation as context generation task and use question answering (QA)
datasets for intermediate training. Specifically, we view QA to be more as a
format than of a task and train GLMs as context generators for a given question
and its respective answer. Then, we cast downstream tasks into question
answering format and adapt the fine-tuned context generators to the target task
domain. Finally, we use the fine-tuned GLM to generate relevant contexts, which
is further used as synthetic training data for their corresponding tasks. We
perform extensive experiments, case studies, and ablation studies on multiple
sentiment and topic classification datasets and demonstrate substantial
improvements in performance in few-shot, zero-shot settings. Remarkably, on the
SST-2 dataset, intermediate training on SocialIQA dataset achieves an
improvement of 40% on Macro-F1 score. Through thorough analyses, we observe
that QA datasets that requires high-level reasoning abilities (e.g.,
abstractive and common-sense QA datasets) tend to give the best boost in
performance in both few-shot and zero-shot settings.",2022-05-25

grounded in an image, using the dialog history as context. Prior work has
trained the dialog agents solely on VisDial data via supervised learning or
leveraged pre-training on related vision-and-language datasets. This paper
presents a semi-supervised learning approach for visually-grounded dialog,
called Generative Self-Training (GST), to leverage unlabeled images on the Web.
Specifically, GST first retrieves in-domain images through out-of-distribution
detection and generates synthetic dialogs regarding the images via multimodal
conditional text generation. GST then trains a dialog agent on the synthetic
and the original VisDial data. As a result, GST scales the amount of training
data up to an order of magnitude that of VisDial (1.2M to 12.9M QA data). For
robust training of the generated dialogs, we also propose perplexity-based data
selection and multimodal consistency regularization. Evaluation on VisDial v1.0
and v0.9 datasets shows that GST achieves new state-of-the-art results on both
datasets. We further observe strong performance gains in the low-data regime

In the case of Data-to-Text (D2T) systems, the factuality of the generated text

training a system both as a generator and a faithfulness discriminator with
additional replacement detection and unlikelihood learning tasks. To facilitate
such training, we propose two methods for sampling unfaithful sentences. We
argue that the poor entity retrieval capability of D2T systems is one of the
primary sources of unfaithfulness, so in addition to the existing metrics, we
further propose NER-based metrics to evaluate the fidelity of D2T generations.

comprehensively investigate performance of two pretrained V&L models under

the VQA task. We also argue that in most cases generative models are less
susceptible to shifts in data distribution, while frequently performing better

improves OOD performance in most settings. Finally, we revisit assumptions

that their stringent nature repeatedly penalizes models for correct responses.",2022-05-24

explicitly visible in an image. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How
do these models work for more complex generative tasks, conditioned on both
text and images? Are models based on joint multimodal pretraining, visually
adapted pretrained language models, or models that combine these two
approaches, more promising for such tasks? We address these questions in the
context of self-rationalization (jointly generating task labels/answers and
free-text explanations) of three tasks: (i) visual question answering in VQA-X,
(ii) visual commonsense reasoning in VCR, and (iii) visual-textual entailment

representations and scaling of language models, do not consistently improve
multimodal self-rationalization of tasks with multimodal inputs. We also
observe that no model type works universally the best across tasks/datasets and

  In this work, we conduct an empirical study of both fine-tuned and

performance as a function of the amount of task-specific data and how these
data are incorporated into the models: zero and few-shot learning, and
fine-tuning of model weights. In addition, we probe the limits of PLMs by
measuring performance on subsets of the evaluation data: novel predicates and
abstractive test examples. To improve the performance on these subsets, we
investigate two techniques: providing predicate descriptions in the context and
re-ranking generated candidates by information reflected in the source.

It considers different generation paradigms as its pre-training tasks including
Auto-regressive (AR), Non-Autoregressive (NAR), and semi-Non-Autoregressive

method to further improve the generation quality of BANG. Firstly, we propose
the mixed distillation strategy based on the AR stream knowledge. Secondly, we
encourage the model to focus on the samples with the same modality by
self-paced learning. The proposed self-paced mixed distillation algorithm
improves the generation quality and has no influence on the inference latency.
We carry out extensive experiments on summarization and question generation
tasks to validate the effectiveness. To further illustrate the commercial value
of our approach, we conduct experiments on three generation tasks in real-world

becomes the bottleneck on efficiency, because of its linear or sublinear time
complexity with data scale. An alternative is the learned index which has a
theoretically constant time complexity. But most of the existing learned

the RMI consists of multiple simple linear regression models that make fast
prediction in only O(1) time. We successfully optimize and combine SK-LSH and
RMI together into the core model, and organize multiple core models into a
two-layer structure based on a clustering-based partitioning of the whole data

journeys and experiences in more detail. We label 14 entity classes (incl.
environmental factors, diagnostics, biochemical processes, patients'

machine translation (NMT) to speed up inference, has attracted much attention
in both machine learning and natural language processing communities. While NAR
generation can significantly accelerate inference speed for machine
translation, the speedup comes at the cost of sacrificed translation accuracy
compared to its counterpart, auto-regressive (AR) generation. In recent years,
many new models and algorithms have been designed/proposed to bridge the
accuracy gap between NAR generation and AR generation. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of various
non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models from different aspects.
Specifically, we categorize the efforts of NAT into several groups, including
data manipulation, modeling methods, training criterion, decoding algorithms,
and the benefit from pre-trained models. Furthermore, we briefly review other
applications of NAR models beyond machine translation, such as dialogue
generation, text summarization, grammar error correction, semantic parsing,
speech synthesis, and automatic speech recognition. In addition, we also
discuss potential directions for future exploration, including releasing the
dependency of KD, dynamic length prediction, pre-training for NAR, and wider
applications, etc. We hope this survey can help researchers capture the latest
progress in NAR generation, inspire the design of advanced NAR models and

graph that is connected and acyclic can be attributed to its structural
constraints, while the semantics of a graph can refer to how meaningfully an

pre-trained language models that generate explanation graphs in an end-to-end

Alongside this, there have been many studies focused on online authorship

texts. Given the power of natural language models in generating convincing
texts, this paper examines the degree to which these language models can
generate texts capable of deceiving online AA models. Experimenting with both

the existing posts of online users. We then examine whether these AI-based text
generators are capable of mimicking authorial style to such a degree that they
can deceive typical AA models. From this, we find that current AI-based text

  Relating the text topics to various business areas of interest, we argue that
competing in a business area in which data value decays rapidly alters

trained to generate text and then fine-tuned to classify facial images. During
the finetuning process with images, most of the layers of GT-2 are frozen
during backpropagation and the model is frozen pretrained transformer (FPT).
The FPT acts as a universal image classifier, and this paper shows the
application of FPT on facial images. We also use our FPT on encrypted images
for classification. Our FPT shows high accuracy on both raw facial images and
encrypted images. We hypothesize the meta-learning capacity FPT gained because
of its large size and trained on a large size with theory and experiments. The
GPT-2 trained to generate a single word token at a time, through the
autoregressive process, forced to heavy-tail distribution. Then the FPT uses
the heavy-tail property as its meta-learning capacity for classifying images.
Our work shows one way to avoid bias during the machine classification of
images.The FPT encodes worldly knowledge because of the pretraining of one
text, which it uses during the classification. The statistical error of
classification is reduced because of the added context gained from the text.Our
paper shows the ethical dimension of using encrypted data for
classification.Criminal images are sensitive to share across the boundary but
encrypted largely evades ethical concern.FPT showing good classification
accuracy on encrypted images shows promise for further research on

An Application of Pseudo-Log-Likelihoods to Natural Language Scoring,2022-01-23 22:00:54+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09377v1,"Darren Abramson, Ali Emami","cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG",table2text,"Language models built using semi-supervised machine learning on large corpora
of natural language have very quickly enveloped the fields of natural language
generation and understanding. In this paper we apply a zero-shot approach
independently developed by a number of researchers now gaining recognition as a
significant alternative to fine-tuning for evaluation on common sense tasks. A
language model with relatively few parameters and training steps compared to a
more recent language model (T5) can outperform it on a recent large data set
(TimeDial), while displaying robustness in its performance across a similar
class of language tasks. Surprisingly, this result is achieved by using a
hyperparameter-free zero-shot method with the smaller model, compared to
fine-tuning to the larger model. We argue that robustness of the smaller model
ought to be understood in terms of compositionality, in a sense that we draw
from recent literature on a class of similar models. We identify a practical
cost for our method and model: high GPU-time for natural language evaluation.
The zero-shot measurement technique that produces remarkable stability, both
for ALBERT and other BERT variants, is an application of pseudo-log-likelihoods
to masked language models for the relative measurement of probability for
substitution alternatives in forced choice language tasks such as the Winograd
Schema Challenge, Winogrande, and others. One contribution of this paper is to
bring together a number of similar, but independent strands of research. We
produce some absolute state-of-the-art results for common sense reasoning in
binary choice tasks, performing better than any published result in the

the model's performance under adversarial settings, which we argue is best

altering the style of a given sentence to a target one while keeping its

recent works mainly focus on solving the problem in an unsupervised manner.
However, previous gradient-based works generally suffer from the deficiencies
as follows, namely: (1) Content migration. Previous approaches lack explicit
modeling of content invariance and are thus susceptible to content shift
between the original sentence and the transferred one. (2) Style
misclassification. A natural drawback of the gradient-guided approaches is that
the inference process is homogeneous with a line of adversarial attack, making
latent optimization easily becomes an attack to the classifier due to
misclassification. This leads to difficulties in achieving high transfer
accuracy. To address the problems, we propose a novel gradient-guided model
through a contrastive paradigm for text style transfer, to explicitly gather
similar semantic sentences, and to design a siamese-structure based style

the need of a large number of high-quality image-text pairs. While image
samples are often easily accessible, the associated text descriptions typically
require careful human captioning, which is particularly time- and
cost-consuming. In this paper, we propose the first work to train text-to-image
generation models without any text data. Our method leverages the well-aligned
multi-modal semantic space of the powerful pre-trained CLIP model: the
requirement of text-conditioning is seamlessly alleviated via generating text
features from image features. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method. We obtain state-of-the-art results in
the standard text-to-image generation tasks. Importantly, the proposed
language-free model outperforms most existing models trained with full
image-text pairs. Furthermore, our method can be applied in fine-tuning
pre-trained models, which saves both training time and cost in training
text-to-image generation models. Our pre-trained model obtains competitive
results in zero-shot text-to-image generation on the MS-COCO dataset, yet with
around only 1% of the model size and training data size relative to the
recently proposed large DALL-E model.",2021-11-27

tasks and lately have gained popularity for image generation as well. However,
they have seen limited use for the synthesis of 3D shapes so far. This is
mainly due to the lack of a straightforward way to linearize 3D data as well as
to scaling problems with the length of the resulting sequences when describing
complex shapes. In this work we address both of these problems. We use octrees
as a compact hierarchical shape representation that can be sequentialized by
traversal ordering. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive compression scheme, that
significantly reduces sequence lengths and thus enables their effective
generation with a transformer, while still allowing fully autoregressive
sampling and parallel training. We demonstrate the performance of our model by
comparing against the state-of-the-art in shape generation.",2021-11-24

to generate a text description. Most previous methods solve this task using a

model the local and global structural information between and within RDF
triples. Moreover, the previous methods also face the non-negligible problem of
low faithfulness of the generated text, which seriously affects the overall
performance of these models. To solve these problems, we propose a model
combining two new graph-augmented structural neural encoders to jointly learn
both local and global structural information in the input RDF triples. To
further improve text faithfulness, we innovatively introduce a reinforcement
learning (RL) reward based on information extraction (IE). We first extract
triples from the generated text using a pretrained IE model and regard the
correct number of the extracted triples as the additional RL reward.
Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed
model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines, and the additional
reinforcement learning reward does help to improve the faithfulness of the

copying text they have seen before, or have they learned generalizable
linguistic abstractions? To tease apart these possibilities, we introduce
RAVEN, a suite of analyses for assessing the novelty of generated text,
focusing on sequential structure (n-grams) and syntactic structure. We apply
these analyses to four neural language models (an LSTM, a Transformer,
Transformer-XL, and GPT-2). For local structure - e.g., individual dependencies
- model-generated text is substantially less novel than our baseline of
human-generated text from each model's test set. For larger-scale structure -
e.g., overall sentence structure - model-generated text is as novel or even
more novel than the human-generated baseline, but models still sometimes copy
substantially, in some cases duplicating passages over 1,000 words long from
the training set. We also perform extensive manual analysis showing that
GPT-2's novel text is usually well-formed morphologically and syntactically but
has reasonably frequent semantic issues (e.g., being self-contradictory).",2021-11-18

the past few years. Hitherto, most of the research has been based on supervised
learning, but its main drawback is the unavailability of labeled data samples

generative models and learn comprehensive representations without supervision.
Even though continuous latent variables are employed primarily in deep latent
variable models, discrete latent variables, with their enhanced
understandability and better compressed representations, are effectively used
by researchers. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised discrete latent
variable model for multi-class text classification and text generation. The
proposed model employs the concept of transfer learning for training a
quantized transformer model, which is able to learn competently using fewer
labeled instances. The model applies decomposed vector quantization technique
to overcome problems like posterior collapse and index collapse. Shannon
entropy is used for the decomposed sub-encoders, on which a variable
DropConnect is applied, to retain maximum information. Moreover, gradients of
the Loss function are adaptively modified during backpropagation from decoder
to encoder to enhance the performance of the model. Three conventional datasets
of diversified range have been used for validating the proposed model on a
variable number of labeled instances. Experimental results indicate that the
proposed model has surpassed the state-of-the-art models remarkably.",2021-11-10

of PAD predictions. In this paper, we tackle the problem of explaining PAD
predictions through natural language. Our approach passes feature
representations of a deep layer of the PAD model to a language model to
generate text describing the reasoning behind the PAD prediction. Due to the
limited amount of annotated data in our study, we apply a light-weight LSTM
network as our natural language generation model. We investigate how the
quality of the generated explanations is affected by different loss functions,
including the commonly used word-wise cross entropy loss, a sentence
discriminative loss, and a sentence semantic loss. We perform our experiments
using face images from a dataset consisting of 1,105 bona-fide and 924
presentation attack samples. Our quantitative and qualitative results show the
effectiveness of our model for generating proper PAD explanations through text

machine-generated. We propose a method to detect those machine-generated
documents leveraging repeated higher-order n-grams, which we show over-appear
in machine-generated text as compared to human ones. That weak signal is the
starting point of a self-training setting where pseudo-labelled documents are
used to train an ensemble of classifiers. Our experiments show that leveraging
that signal allows us to rank suspicious documents accurately. Precision at
