Text Simplification by Tagging,2021-03-08 20:57:55+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.05070v1,"Kostiantyn Omelianchuk, Vipul Raheja, Oleksandr Skurzhanskyi",cs.CL,table2text,"Edit-based approaches have recently shown promising results on multiple
monolingual sequence transduction tasks. In contrast to conventional
sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) models, which learn to generate text from
scratch as they are trained on parallel corpora, these methods have proven to
be much more effective since they are able to learn to make fast and accurate
transformations while leveraging powerful pre-trained language models. Inspired
by these ideas, we present TST, a simple and efficient Text Simplification
system based on sequence Tagging, leveraging pre-trained Transformer-based
encoders. Our system makes simplistic data augmentations and tweaks in training
and inference on a pre-existing system, which makes it less reliant on large
amounts of parallel training data, provides more control over the outputs and
enables faster inference speeds. Our best model achieves near state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark test datasets for the task. Since it is fully
non-autoregressive, it achieves faster inference speeds by over 11 times than
the current state-of-the-art text simplification system.",2021-03-08

with human judgements. Then based on these metrics, we quantitatively analyze
the correlation between training data quality and generation fidelity which
indicates the potential usage of entity information in faithful generation.
Motivated by these findings, we propose two methods for faithful generation: 1)
augmented training by incorporating the auxiliary entity information, including
both an augmented plan-based model and an unsupervised model and 2) training

pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural
models include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their

examples. In this work, we investigate whether there are more effective
strategies for judiciously selecting in-context examples (relative to random
sampling) that better leverage GPT-$3$'s few-shot capabilities. Inspired by the
recent success of leveraging a retrieval module to augment large-scale neural

approach on several natural language understanding and generation benchmarks,
where the retrieval-based prompt selection approach consistently outperforms
the random baseline. Moreover, it is observed that the sentence encoders
fine-tuned on task-related datasets yield even more helpful retrieval results.
Notably, significant gains are observed on tasks such as table-to-text

particular ideological slant (eg., liberal or conservative), the framework
first detects polar language in the article and then generates a new article
with the polar language replaced with neutral expressions. To detect polar
words, we train a multi-attribute-aware word embedding model that is aware of
ideology and topics on 360k full-length media articles. Then, for text
generation, we propose a new algorithm called Text Annealing Depolarization

approach for directly optimizing non-differentiable evaluation metrics for

leads to improvements in mostly that metric only, suggesting that the model is
gaming the formulation of that metric in a particular way without often
achieving real qualitative improvements. Hence, it is more beneficial to make
the model optimize multiple diverse metric rewards jointly. While appealing,
this is challenging because one needs to manually decide the importance and
scaling weights of these metric rewards. Further, it is important to consider
using a dynamic combination and curriculum of metric rewards that flexibly
changes over time. Considering the above aspects, in our work, we automate the
optimization of multiple metric rewards simultaneously via a multi-armed bandit
approach (DORB), where at each round, the bandit chooses which metric reward to
optimize next, based on expected arm gains. We use the Exp3 algorithm for
bandits and formulate two approaches for bandit rewards: (1) Single
Multi-reward Bandit (SM-Bandit); (2) Hierarchical Multi-reward Bandit
(HM-Bandit). We empirically show the effectiveness of our approaches via
various automatic metrics and human evaluation on two important NLG tasks:
question generation and data-to-text generation, including on an unseen-test

wayward model might generalize in undesirable ways too, say to nonsensical

language models trained on (positive) training data also generalize to

special treatment for these, and still regard these as words in natural
language text. Secondly, the target texts in training dataset may contain
redundant information or facts do not exist in the input tables. These may give
wrong supervision signals to some methods based on content selection and

benefit from using data for pre-existing ontologies. Here we explore, for the
first time, whether it is possible to train an NLG for a new larger ontology
using existing training sets for the restaurant domain, where each set is based
on a different ontology. We create a new, larger combined ontology, and then
train an NLG to produce utterances covering it. For example, if one dataset has
attributes for family-friendly and rating information, and the other has
attributes for decor and service, our aim is an NLG for the combined ontology
that can produce utterances that realize values for family-friendly, rating,
decor and service. Initial experiments with a baseline neural
sequence-to-sequence model show that this task is surprisingly challenging. We
then develop a novel self-training method that identifies (errorful) model
outputs, automatically constructs a corrected MR input to form a new (MR,
utterance) training pair, and then repeatedly adds these new instances back
into the training data. We then test the resulting model on a new test set. The
result is a self-trained model whose performance is an absolute 75.4%
improvement over the baseline model. We also report a human qualitative
evaluation of the final model showing that it achieves high naturalness,
semantic coherence and grammaticality",2020-09-30

various utterance-level dialogue understanding tasks. Most of these approaches
account for the context for effective understanding. In this paper, we explore

find the most similar prior text in the training data of GPT-2. We take a
reranking approach and apply it to the patent domain. Specifically, we
pre-train GPT-2 models from scratch by using the patent data from the USPTO.
The input for the prior art search is the patent text generated by the GPT-2

the training data of GPT-2 by taking a bag-of-word ranking approach (BM25), (2)
convert the search results in text format to BERT embeddings, and (3) provide
the final result by ranking the BERT embeddings based on their similarities
with the patent text generated by GPT-2. The experiments in this work show that
such reranking is better than ranking with embeddings alone. However, our mixed
results also indicate that calculating the semantic similarities among long

advanced attack method. However automatic text generation requires controlling
the context and coherency of the generated content, which has been identified
as an increasingly difficult problem. The method used leverages a hierarchical
deep neural model which uses a learned representation of the sentences in the
input document to generate structured written emails. We demonstrate the
generation of short and targeted text messages using the deep model. The global
coherency of the synthesized text is evaluated using a qualitative study as
well as multiple quantitative measures.",2020-07-14

  Morphologically Rich Online ASR",2020-07-14 10:22:05+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06949v3,"Balázs Tarján, György Szaszák, Tibor Fegyó, Péter Mihajlik","eess.AS, cs.CL",table2text,"Recently Deep Transformer models have proven to be particularly powerful in
language modeling tasks for ASR. Their high complexity, however, makes them
very difficult to apply in the first (single) pass of an online system. Recent
studies showed that a considerable part of the knowledge of neural network
Language Models (LM) can be transferred to traditional n-grams by using neural
text generation based data augmentation. In our paper, we pre-train a GPT-2
Transformer LM on a general text corpus and fine-tune it on our Hungarian
conversational call center ASR task. We show that although data augmentation
with Transformer-generated text works well for isolating languages, it causes a
vocabulary explosion in a morphologically rich language. Therefore, we propose
a new method called subword-based neural text augmentation, where we retokenize
the generated text into statistically derived subwords. We compare Morfessor
and BPE statistical subword tokenizers and show that both methods can
significantly improve the WER while greatly reducing vocabulary size and memory
requirements. Finally, we also demonstrate that subword-based neural text
augmentation outperforms the word-based approach not only in terms of overall
WER but also in recognition of OOV words.",2020-07-14
