"How to Fill the Optimum Set? Population Gradient Descent with Harmless
  Diversity",2022-02-16 23:40:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08376v1,"Chengyue Gong, Lemeng Wu, Qiang Liu","cs.LG, cs.CV",image2text,"Although traditional optimization methods focus on finding a single optimal
solution, most objective functions in modern machine learning problems,
especially those in deep learning, often have multiple or infinite numbers of
optima. Therefore, it is useful to consider the problem of finding a set of
diverse points in the optimum set of an objective function. In this work, we
frame this problem as a bi-level optimization problem of maximizing a diversity
score inside the optimum set of the main loss function, and solve it with a
simple population gradient descent framework that iteratively updates the
points to maximize the diversity score in a fashion that does not hurt the
optimization of the main loss. We demonstrate that our method can efficiently
generate diverse solutions on a variety of applications, including
text-to-image generation, text-to-mesh generation, molecular conformation
generation and ensemble neural network training.",2022-02-16

In this context, this paper introduces a dataset, model, and triple-level
evaluation. The dataset consists of 22k caption-clip pairs and three visual
features (images, optical flow, inpainting) for ~500 hours of \emph{SoccerNet}
videos. The model is divided into three parts: a transformer learns language,
ConvNets learn vision, and a fusion of linguistic and visual features generates
captions. The paper suggests evaluating generated captions at three levels:
syntax (the commonly used evaluation metrics such as BLEU-score and CIDEr),
meaning (the quality of descriptions for a domain expert), and corpus (the
diversity of generated captions). The paper shows that the diversity of
generated captions has improved (from 0.07 reaching 0.18) with
semantics-related losses that prioritize selected words. Semantics-related
losses and the utilization of more visual features (optical flow, inpainting)
improved the normalized captioning score by 28\%. The web page of this work:

Pre-Trained Language Transformers are Universal Image Classifiers,2022-01-25 08:56:14+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10182v1,"Rahul Goel, Modar Sulaiman, Kimia Noorbakhsh, Mahdi Sharifi, Rajesh Sharma, Pooyan Jamshidi, Kallol Roy","cs.CV, cs.AI",image2text,"Facial images disclose many hidden personal traits such as age, gender, race,
health, emotion, and psychology. Understanding these traits will help to
classify the people in different attributes. In this paper, we have presented a
novel method for classifying images using a pretrained transformer model. We
apply the pretrained transformer for the binary classification of facial images
in criminal and non-criminal classes. The pretrained transformer of GPT-2 is
trained to generate text and then fine-tuned to classify facial images. During
the finetuning process with images, most of the layers of GT-2 are frozen
during backpropagation and the model is frozen pretrained transformer (FPT).
The FPT acts as a universal image classifier, and this paper shows the
application of FPT on facial images. We also use our FPT on encrypted images
for classification. Our FPT shows high accuracy on both raw facial images and
encrypted images. We hypothesize the meta-learning capacity FPT gained because
of its large size and trained on a large size with theory and experiments. The
GPT-2 trained to generate a single word token at a time, through the
autoregressive process, forced to heavy-tail distribution. Then the FPT uses
the heavy-tail property as its meta-learning capacity for classifying images.
Our work shows one way to avoid bias during the machine classification of
images.The FPT encodes worldly knowledge because of the pretraining of one
text, which it uses during the classification. The statistical error of
classification is reduced because of the added context gained from the text.Our
paper shows the ethical dimension of using encrypted data for
classification.Criminal images are sensitive to share across the boundary but
encrypted largely evades ethical concern.FPT showing good classification
accuracy on encrypted images shows promise for further research on

An Integrated Approach for Video Captioning and Applications,2022-01-23 01:06:00+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09153v1,"Soheyla Amirian, Thiab R. Taha, Khaled Rasheed, Hamid R. Arabnia","cs.CV, cs.AI",image2text,"Physical computing infrastructure, data gathering, and algorithms have
recently had significant advances to extract information from images and
videos. The growth has been especially outstanding in image captioning and
video captioning. However, most of the advancements in video captioning still
take place in short videos. In this research, we caption longer videos only by
using the keyframes, which are a small subset of the total video frames.
Instead of processing thousands of frames, only a few frames are processed
depending on the number of keyframes. There is a trade-off between the
computation of many frames and the speed of the captioning process. The
approach in this research is to allow the user to specify the trade-off between
execution time and accuracy. In addition, we argue that linking images, videos,
and natural language offers many practical benefits and immediate practical
applications. From the modeling perspective, instead of designing and staging
explicit algorithms to process videos and generate captions in complex

Compact Bidirectional Transformer for Image Captioning,2022-01-06 09:23:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01984v1,"Yuanen Zhou, Zhenzhen Hu, Daqing Liu, Huixia Ben, Meng Wang","cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"Most current image captioning models typically generate captions from left to
right. This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context
but not future context. Though recent refinement-based models can exploit both
past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based
on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of
these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner
in the first stage and a refiner in the second stage), which can only be
executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional
Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context
implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly.
Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and
right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model~(i.e. implicitly) and
optionally allowing interaction of the two flows(i.e. explicitly), while the
final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level
ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on the MSCOCO benchmark
and find that the compact architecture, which serves as a regularization for
implicitly exploiting bidirectional context, and the sentence-level ensemble
play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining
with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of the sentence-level ensemble
is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical
training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new

NLG models have been encapsulated in cloud APIs to serve over half a billion
people worldwide and process over one hundred billion word generations per day.
Thus, NLG APIs have already become essential profitable services in many
commercial companies. Due to the substantial financial and intellectual
investments, service providers adopt a pay-as-you-use policy to promote
sustainable market growth. However, recent works have shown that cloud
platforms suffer from financial losses imposed by model extraction attacks,
which aim to imitate the functionality and utility of the victim services, thus
violating the intellectual property (IP) of cloud APIs. This work targets at
protecting IP of NLG APIs by identifying the attackers who have utilized
watermarked responses from the victim NLG APIs. However, most existing
watermarking techniques are not directly amenable for IP protection of NLG
APIs. To bridge this gap, we first present a novel watermarking method for text
generation APIs by conducting lexical modification to the original outputs.
Compared with the competitive baselines, our watermark approach achieves better
identifiable performance in terms of p-value, with fewer semantic losses. In
addition, our watermarks are more understandable and intuitive to humans than
the baselines. Finally, the empirical studies show our approach is also
applicable to queries from different domains, and is effective on the attacker

Prediction consistency. CPRC utilizes the prediction of raw image as soft label
to distill useful supervision for the generated sentence, rather than employing

Our results reveal that using Self-Critical Sequence Training to optimize
CIDEr-R generates descriptive captions. In contrast, when CIDEr-D is optimized,

are even able to generate samples with rare or unseen combinations of
attributes in the dataset, such as a young person with gray hair, men with
make-up, or women with beards. We combined PluGeN with GAN and VAE models and

Automated image captioning techniques utilize encoder and decoder architecture,

the localized ratio of the geometrical properties of the proposals. The
label-attention module associates the extracted objects classes to the

method that encourages discriminability in image caption generation. We show
that more discriminative captioning models generate more descriptive captions.
In Chapter 5, we study how training objectives and sampling methods affect the

Logic-Consistency Text Generation from Semantic Parses,2021-08-02 01:12:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00577v1,"Chang Shu, Yusen Zhang, Xiangyu Dong, Peng Shi, Tao Yu, Rui Zhang",cs.CL,image2text,"Text generation from semantic parses is to generate textual descriptions for
formal representation inputs such as logic forms and SQL queries. This is
challenging due to two reasons: (1) the complex and intensive inner logic with
the data scarcity constraint, (2) the lack of automatic evaluation metrics for
logic consistency. To address these two challenges, this paper first proposes
SNOWBALL, a framework for logic consistent text generation from semantic parses
that employs an iterative training procedure by recursively augmenting the
training set with quality control. Second, we propose a novel automatic metric,
BLEC, for evaluating the logical consistency between the semantic parses and
generated texts. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets, Logic2Text
and Spider, demonstrate the SNOWBALL framework enhances the logic consistency
on both BLEC and human evaluation. Furthermore, our statistical analysis

(OCR) engines to transform handwritten images into transcripts on which
downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are applied. In this
process, OCR engines may introduce errors and inputs to downstream NLP models
become noisy. Despite that pre-trained models achieve state-of-the-art
performance in many NLP benchmarks, we prove that they are not robust to noisy
texts generated by real OCR engines. This greatly limits the application of NLP
models in real-world scenarios. In order to improve model performance on noisy
OCR transcripts, it is natural to train the NLP model on labelled noisy texts.
However, in most cases there are only labelled clean texts. Since there is no
handwritten pictures corresponding to the text, it is impossible to directly
use the recognition model to obtain noisy labelled data. Human resources can be
employed to copy texts and take pictures, but it is extremely expensive
considering the size of data for model training. Consequently, we are
interested in making NLP models intrinsically robust to OCR errors in a low
resource manner. We propose a novel robust training framework which 1) employs
simple but effective methods to directly simulate natural OCR noises from clean
texts and 2) iteratively mines the hard examples from a large number of
simulated samples for optimal performance. 3) To make our model learn
noise-invariant representations, a stability loss is employed. Experiments on

robustness of pre-trained models by a large margin. We believe that this work

the algorithm we use is simple and straightforward. We make our codes and three

multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond
corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes
corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous

formulating image captioning as a single sequence-to-sequence task. Although
promising, we observed two problems in generated captions: 1) content
inconsistency where models would generate contradicting facts; 2) not
informative enough where models would miss parts of important information. From
a causal perspective, the reason is that models have captured spurious
statistical correlations between visual features and certain expressions (e.g.,
visual features of ""long hair"" and ""woman""). In this paper, we propose a
dependent multi-task learning framework with the causal intervention (DMTCI).
Firstly, we involve an intermediate task, bag-of-categories generation, before
the final task, image captioning. The intermediate task would help the model
better understand the visual features and thus alleviate the content
inconsistency problem. Secondly, we apply Pearl's do-calculus on the model,
cutting off the link between the visual features and possible confounders and
thus letting models focus on the causal visual features. Specifically, the
high-frequency concept set is considered as the proxy confounders where the
real confounders are inferred in the continuous space. Finally, we use a

Controllable and Diverse Text Generation in E-commerce,2021-02-23 05:16:27+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11497v1,"Huajie Shao, Jun Wang, Haohong Lin, Xuezhou Zhang, Aston Zhang, Heng Ji, Tarek Abdelzaher",cs.LG,image2text,"In E-commerce, a key challenge in text generation is to find a good trade-off
between word diversity and accuracy (relevance) in order to make generated text
appear more natural and human-like. In order to improve the relevance of
generated results, conditional text generators were developed that use input
keywords or attributes to produce the corresponding text. Prior work, however,
do not finely control the diversity of automatically generated sentences. For
example, it does not control the order of keywords to put more relevant ones
first. Moreover, it does not explicitly control the balance between diversity
and accuracy. To remedy these problems, we propose a fine-grained controllable
generative model, called~\textit{Apex}, that uses an algorithm borrowed from
automatic control (namely, a variant of the \textit{proportional, integral, and
derivative (PID) controller}) to precisely manipulate the diversity/accuracy
trade-off of generated text. The algorithm is injected into a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), allowing \textit{Apex} to control both (i) the
order of keywords in the generated sentences (conditioned on the input keywords
and their order), and (ii) the trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Evaluation results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms existing generative models in terms of diversity and relevance.
Apex is currently deployed to generate production descriptions and item
recommendation reasons in Taobao owned by Alibaba, the largest E-commerce
platform in China. The A/B production test results show that our method
improves click-through rate (CTR) by 13.17\% compared to the existing method

increase CTR by 6.89\% and 1.42\% compared to user reviews and top-K item

attributes. Several studies have noted that naive use of scene graphs from a
black-box scene graph generator harms image caption-ing performance, and scene
graph-based captioning mod-els have to incur the overhead of explicit use of

spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an
additional HOI graph. Our framework outperforms existing scene graph-only

pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural

leverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training

accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective

To achieve this, we also developed an in-domain NLI model via weak supervision

discourse phenomena for task-oriented dialogue modeling, we propose RiSAWOZ, a
large-scale multi-domain Chinese Wizard-of-Oz dataset with Rich Semantic
Annotations. RiSAWOZ contains 11.2K human-to-human (H2H) multi-turn
semantically annotated dialogues, with more than 150K utterances spanning over
12 domains, which is larger than all previous annotated H2H conversational
datasets. Both single- and multi-domain dialogues are constructed, accounting
for 65% and 35%, respectively. Each dialogue is labeled with comprehensive
dialogue annotations, including dialogue goal in the form of natural language
description, domain, dialogue states and acts at both the user and system side.
In addition to traditional dialogue annotations, we especially provide
linguistic annotations on discourse phenomena, e.g., ellipsis and coreference,
in dialogues, which are useful for dialogue coreference and ellipsis resolution
tasks. Apart from the fully annotated dataset, we also present a detailed
description of the data collection procedure, statistics and analysis of the
dataset. A series of benchmark models and results are reported, including
natural language understanding (intent detection & slot filling), dialogue
state tracking and dialogue context-to-text generation, as well as coreference
and ellipsis resolution, which facilitate the baseline comparison for future
research on this corpus.",2020-10-17
Dissecting the components and factors of Neural Text Generation,2020-10-14 17:54:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07279v1,"Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Alan W Black",cs.CL,image2text,"Neural text generation metamorphosed into several critical natural language
applications ranging from text completion to free form narrative generation.
Generating natural language has fundamentally been a human attribute and the
advent of ubiquitous NLP applications and virtual agents marks the need to
impart this skill to machines. There has been a colossal research effort in
various frontiers of neural text generation including machine translation,
summarization, image captioning, storytelling etc., We believe that this is an
excellent juncture to retrospect on the directions of the field. Specifically,
this paper surveys the fundamental factors and components relaying task
agnostic impacts across various generation tasks such as storytelling,
summarization, translation etc., In specific, we present an abstraction of the
imperative techniques with respect to learning paradigms, pretraining, modeling
approaches, decoding and the key challenges. Thereby, we hope to deliver a
one-stop destination for researchers in the field to facilitate a perspective
on where to situate their work and how it impacts other closely related tasks.",2020-10-14
"Learning Visual-Semantic Embeddings for Reporting Abnormal Findings on
  Chest X-rays",2020-10-06 04:18:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02467v1,"Jianmo Ni, Chun-Nan Hsu, Amilcare Gentili, Julian McAuley","cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"Automatic medical image report generation has drawn growing attention due to
its potential to alleviate radiologists' workload. Existing work on report
generation often trains encoder-decoder networks to generate complete reports.
However, such models are affected by data bias (e.g.~label imbalance) and face
common issues inherent in text generation models (e.g.~repetition). In this
work, we focus on reporting abnormal findings on radiology images; instead of
training on complete radiology reports, we propose a method to identify
abnormal findings from the reports in addition to grouping them with
unsupervised clustering and minimal rules. We formulate the task as cross-modal
retrieval and propose Conditional Visual-Semantic Embeddings to align images
and fine-grained abnormal findings in a joint embedding space. We demonstrate
that our method is able to retrieve abnormal findings and outperforms existing
generation models on both clinical correctness and text generation metrics.",2020-10-06
"Knowledge-Enhanced Personalized Review Generation with Capsule Graph
  Neural Network",2020-10-04 03:54:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01480v1,"Junyi Li, Siqing Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Gaole He, Zhicheng Wei, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Ji-Rong Wen","cs.CL, cs.AI",image2text,"Personalized review generation (PRG) aims to automatically produce review
text reflecting user preference, which is a challenging natural language
generation task. Most of previous studies do not explicitly model factual
description of products, tending to generate uninformative content. Moreover,
they mainly focus on word-level generation, but cannot accurately reflect more
abstractive user preference in multiple aspects. To address the above issues,
we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced PRG model based on capsule graph neural
network~(Caps-GNN). We first construct a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG)
for utilizing rich item attributes. We adopt Caps-GNN to learn graph capsules
for encoding underlying characteristics from the HKG. Our generation process
contains two major steps, namely aspect sequence generation and sentence
generation. First, based on graph capsules, we adaptively learn aspect capsules
for inferring the aspect sequence. Then, conditioned on the inferred aspect
label, we design a graph-based copy mechanism to generate sentences by
incorporating related entities or words from HKG. To our knowledge, we are the
first to utilize knowledge graph for the PRG task. The incorporated KG
information is able to enhance user preference at both aspect and word levels.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our model on the PRG task.",2020-10-04
