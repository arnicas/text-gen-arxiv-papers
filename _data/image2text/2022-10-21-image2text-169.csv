"Improving the Factual Correctness of Radiology Report Generation with
  Semantic Rewards",2022-10-21 18:27:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12186v1,"Jean-Benoit Delbrouck, Pierre Chambon, Christian Bluethgen, Emily Tsai, Omar Almusa, Curtis P. Langlotz","cs.CL, cs.AI",image2text,"Neural image-to-text radiology report generation systems offer the potential
to improve radiology reporting by reducing the repetitive process of report
drafting and identifying possible medical errors. These systems have achieved
promising performance as measured by widely used NLG metrics such as BLEU and
CIDEr. However, the current systems face important limitations. First, they
present an increased complexity in architecture that offers only marginal
improvements on NLG metrics. Secondly, these systems that achieve high
performance on these metrics are not always factually complete or consistent
due to both inadequate training and evaluation. Recent studies have shown the
systems can be substantially improved by using new methods encouraging 1) the
generation of domain entities consistent with the reference and 2) describing
these entities in inferentially consistent ways. So far, these methods rely on
weakly-supervised approaches (rule-based) and named entity recognition systems
that are not specific to the chest X-ray domain. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a new method, the RadGraph reward, to further improve the factual
completeness and correctness of generated radiology reports. More precisely, we
leverage the RadGraph dataset containing annotated chest X-ray reports with
entities and relations between entities. On two open radiology report datasets,
our system substantially improves the scores up to 14.2% and 25.3% on metrics
evaluating the factual correctness and completeness of reports.",2022-10-21
Image Semantic Relation Generation,2022-10-19 16:15:19+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11253v1,Mingzhe Du,"cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"Scene graphs provide structured semantic understanding beyond images. For
downstream tasks, such as image retrieval, visual question answering, visual
relationship detection, and even autonomous vehicle technology, scene graphs
can not only distil complex image information but also correct the bias of
visual models using semantic-level relations, which has broad application
prospects. However, the heavy labour cost of constructing graph annotations may
hinder the application of PSG in practical scenarios. Inspired by the
observation that people usually identify the subject and object first and then
determine the relationship between them, we proposed to decouple the scene
graphs generation task into two sub-tasks: 1) an image segmentation task to
pick up the qualified objects. 2) a restricted auto-regressive text generation
task to generate the relation between given objects. Therefore, in this work,
we introduce image semantic relation generation (ISRG), a simple but effective
image-to-text model, which achieved 31 points on the OpenPSG dataset and
outperforms strong baselines respectively by 16 points (ResNet-50) and 5 points

the state-of-the-art results in a variety of cross-modal downstream tasks.
Aligning cross-modal semantics is claimed to be one of the essential
capabilities of VLP models. However, it still remains unclear about the inner
working mechanism of alignment in VLP models. In this paper, we propose a new
probing method that is based on image captioning to first empirically study the
cross-modal semantics alignment of VLP models. Our probing method is built upon
the fact that given an image-caption pair, the VLP models will give a score,
indicating how well two modalities are aligned; maximizing such scores will
generate sentences that VLP models believe are of good alignment. Analyzing
these sentences thus will reveal in what way different modalities are aligned
and how well these alignments are in VLP models. We apply our probing method to
five popular VLP models, including UNITER, ROSITA, ViLBERT, CLIP, and LXMERT,
and provide a comprehensive analysis of the generated captions guided by these
models. Our results show that VLP models (1) focus more on just aligning
objects with visual words, while neglecting global semantics; (2) prefer fixed
sentence patterns, thus ignoring more important textual information including
fluency and grammar; and (3) deem the captions with more visual words are
better aligned with images. These findings indicate that VLP models still have
weaknesses in cross-modal semantics alignment and we hope this work will draw
researchers' attention to such problems when designing a new VLP model.",2022-10-18

that models achieving better scores on standard metrics(e.g., BLEU-4, CIDEr)
could hallucinate objects more frequently. Second, we investigate how different
types of visual features in VLP influence hallucination, including
region-based, grid-based, and patch-based. Surprisingly, we find that
patch-based features perform the best and smaller patch resolution yields a
non-trivial reduction in object hallucination. Third, we decouple various VLP
objectives and demonstrate their effectiveness in alleviating object
hallucination. Based on that, we propose a new pre-training loss, object masked
language modeling, to further reduce object hallucination. We evaluate models

data-to-text problems often suffer from various data-scarce issues: one may
have access to only a handful of or no training examples, and/or have to rely

Any-Shot Data-to-Text (ASDOT), a new approach flexibly applicable to diverse

of two steps, data disambiguation and sentence fusion, both of which are

description and progressively add details based on intermediate results. To
capture this recursive process, we introduce a method to generate a 3D shape

phrases are added. Since existing datasets are insufficient for training this
approach, we present Text2Shape++, a large dataset of 369K shape-text pairs

diagnosis, where the text reports of the images are essential in understanding
them and facilitating later treatments. By generating the reports
automatically, it is beneficial to help lighten the burden of radiologists and
significantly promote clinical automation, which already attracts much
attention in applying artificial intelligence to medical domain. Previous
studies mainly follow the encoder-decoder paradigm and focus on the aspect of
text generation, with few studies considering the importance of cross-modal
mappings and explicitly exploit such mappings to facilitate radiology report
generation. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal memory networks (CMN) to
enhance the encoder-decoder framework for radiology report generation, where a
shared memory is designed to record the alignment between images and texts so
as to facilitate the interaction and generation across modalities. Experimental
results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, where
state-of-the-art performance is achieved on two widely used benchmark datasets,

scientific text generated by researchers. However, their direct access to
individual patient experiences or patient-doctor interactions can be limited.
Information provided on social media, e.g., by patients and their relatives,
complements the knowledge in scientific text. It reflects the patient's journey
and their subjective perspective on the process of developing symptoms, being
diagnosed and offered a treatment, being cured or learning to live with a
medical condition. The value of this type of data is therefore twofold:
Firstly, it offers direct access to people's perspectives. Secondly, it might
cover information that is not available elsewhere, including self-treatment or
self-diagnoses. Named entity recognition and relation extraction are methods to
structure information that is available in unstructured text. However, existing
medical social media corpora focused on a comparably small set of entities and
relations and particular domains, rather than putting the patient into the
center of analyses. With this paper we contribute a corpus with a rich set of
annotation layers following the motivation to uncover and model patients'
journeys and experiences in more detail. We label 14 entity classes (incl.
environmental factors, diagnostics, biochemical processes, patients'
quality-of-life descriptions, pathogens, medical conditions, and treatments)
and 20 relation classes (e.g., prevents, influences, interactions, causes) most

Moreover, we make the first steps towards multi-turn interactions, where
conversational search systems asks multiple questions to the (simulated) user

popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and SPICE. However, focusing on the most
popular metrics that only consider the overlap between the generated captions

lacks distinctiveness, i.e., many similar images have the same caption. In this
paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions via comparing
and reweighting with a set of similar images. First, we propose a
distinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the
distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our
metric reveals that the human annotations of each image in the MSCOCO dataset
are not equivalent based on distinctiveness; however, previous works normally
treat the human annotations equally during training, which could be a reason
for generating less distinctive captions. In contrast, we reweight each
ground-truth caption according to its distinctiveness during training. We
further integrate a long-tailed weight strategy to highlight the rare words
that contain more information, and captions from the similar image set are
sampled as negative examples to encourage the generated sentence to be unique.
Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed
approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw
and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide

classification is reduced because of the added context gained from the text.Our

The proposed method starts with our unified conditional model -- a vision
language BERT model that can perform zero-shot conditional generation. Given
different conditions, the unified conditional model can generate captions,
dense captions, and even questions. We use the labeled image data to train a
teacher model and use the trained model to generate pseudo captions on
unlabeled image data. We then combine the labeled data and pseudo labeled data
to train a student model. The process is iterated by putting the student model
as a new teacher. By using the proposed self-training approach and only 300k
unlabeled extra data, we are able to get competitive or even better
performances compared to the models of similar model size trained with 3

Compact Bidirectional Transformer for Image Captioning,2022-01-06 09:23:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01984v1,"Yuanen Zhou, Zhenzhen Hu, Daqing Liu, Huixia Ben, Meng Wang","cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"Most current image captioning models typically generate captions from left to
right. This unidirectional property makes them can only leverage past context
but not future context. Though recent refinement-based models can exploit both
past and future context by generating a new caption in the second stage based
on pre-retrieved or pre-generated captions in the first stage, the decoder of
these models generally consists of two networks~(i.e. a retriever or captioner
in the first stage and a refiner in the second stage), which can only be
executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional
Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context
implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly.
Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and
right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model~(i.e. implicitly) and
optionally allowing interaction of the two flows(i.e. explicitly), while the
final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level
ensemble manner. We conduct extensive ablation studies on the MSCOCO benchmark
and find that the compact architecture, which serves as a regularization for
implicitly exploiting bidirectional context, and the sentence-level ensemble
play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining
with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of the sentence-level ensemble
is further enlarged. We further extend the conventional one-flow self-critical
training to the two-flows version under this architecture and achieve new

auto-regressive transformer (BiART) for text-to-image and image-to-text
generation. Our AugVAE shows the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on
ImageNet1K validation set, along with the robustness to unseen images in the
wild. Unlike other models, BiART can distinguish between image (or text) as a
conditional reference and a generation target. L-Verse can be directly used for
image-to-text or text-to-image generation tasks without any finetuning or extra
object detection frameworks. In quantitative and qualitative experiments,
L-Verse shows impressive results against previous methods in both image-to-text
and text-to-image generation on MS-COCO Captions. We furthermore assess the
scalability of L-Verse architecture on Conceptual Captions and present the
initial results of bidirectional vision-language representation learning on

to generate a text description. Most previous methods solve this task using a
sequence-to-sequence model or using a graph-based model to encode RDF triples

model the local and global structural information between and within RDF
triples. Moreover, the previous methods also face the non-negligible problem of
low faithfulness of the generated text, which seriously affects the overall
performance of these models. To solve these problems, we propose a model
combining two new graph-augmented structural neural encoders to jointly learn
both local and global structural information in the input RDF triples. To
further improve text faithfulness, we innovatively introduce a reinforcement
learning (RL) reward based on information extraction (IE). We first extract
triples from the generated text using a pretrained IE model and regard the
correct number of the extracted triples as the additional RL reward.
Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed

described images and a large number of undescribed images. Therefore, a
resulting challenge is how to effectively combine the undescribed images into

novel image captioning method by exploiting the Cross-modal Prediction and
Relation Consistency (CPRC), which aims to utilize the raw image input to
constrain the generated sentence in the commonly semantic space. In detail,
considering that the heterogeneous gap between modalities always leads to the
supervision difficulty of using the global embedding directly, CPRC turns to
transform both the raw image and corresponding generated sentence into the
shared semantic space, and measure the generated sentence from two aspects: 1)
Prediction consistency. CPRC utilizes the prediction of raw image as soft label
to distill useful supervision for the generated sentence, rather than employing
the traditional pseudo labeling; 2) Relation consistency. CPRC develops a novel
relation consistency between augmented images and corresponding generated
sentences to retain the important relational knowledge. In result, CPRC
supervises the generated sentence from both the informativeness and
representativeness perspectives, and can reasonably use the undescribed images

Multimodal Conditionality for Natural Language Generation,2021-09-02 22:06:07+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01229v1,"Michael Sollami, Aashish Jain","cs.CL, cs.LG",image2text,"Large scale pretrained language models have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance in language understanding tasks. Their application has recently
expanded into multimodality learning, leading to improved representations

towards conditional Natural Language Generation (NLG) has been limited to a
single modality, generally text. We propose MAnTiS, Multimodal Adaptation for
Text Synthesis, a general approach for multimodal conditionality in
transformer-based NLG models. In this method, we pass inputs from each modality
through modality-specific encoders, project to textual token space, and finally
join to form a conditionality prefix. We fine-tune the pretrained language
model and encoders with the conditionality prefix guiding the generation. We
apply MAnTiS to the task of product description generation, conditioning a
network on both product images and titles to generate descriptive text. We
demonstrate that MAnTiS outperforms strong baseline approaches on standard NLG

Goal-driven text descriptions for images,2021-08-28 05:10:38+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12575v1,Ruotian Luo,"cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"A big part of achieving Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) is to build a
machine that can see and listen like humans. Much work has focused on designing
models for image classification, video classification, object detection, pose
estimation, speech recognition, etc., and has achieved significant progress in
recent years thanks to deep learning. However, understanding the world is not
enough. An AI agent also needs to know how to talk, especially how to
communicate with a human. While perception (vision, for example) is more common
across animal species, the use of complicated language is unique to humans and
is one of the most important aspects of intelligence.
  In this thesis, we focus on generating textual output given visual input. In
Chapter 3, we focus on generating the referring expression, a text description
for an object in the image so that a receiver can infer which object is being
described. We use a comprehension machine to directly guide the generated
referring expressions to be more discriminative. In Chapter 4, we introduce a
method that encourages discriminability in image caption generation. We show
that more discriminative captioning models generate more descriptive captions.
In Chapter 5, we study how training objectives and sampling methods affect the
models' ability to generate diverse captions. We find that a popular captioning
training strategy will be detrimental to the diversity of generated captions.
In Chapter 6, we propose a model that can control the length of generated
captions. By changing the desired length, one can influence the style and
descriptiveness of the captions. Finally, in Chapter 7, we rank/generate
informative image tags according to their information utility. The proposed
method better matches what humans think are the most important tags for the

generating anything; hence the output space is unconstrained. A self-driving
car is driven for 100 million miles to validate its safety, but tests cannot be
written to monitor and cover an unconstrained space. One of the solutions to
validate AI-generated content is to constrain the problem and convert it from
abstract to realistic, and this can be accomplished by either validating the
unconstrained algorithm using theoretical proofs or by using Monte-Carlo
simulation methods. In this case, we use the latter approach to test/validate a
statistically significant number of samples. This hypothesis of validating the
AI-generated code is the main motive of this work and to know if AI-generated

challenging task as programs can have different logic with different naming
conventions, but the metrics must capture the structure and logic of the
program. This is similar to the importance grammar carries in AI-based text
generation, Q&A, translations, etc. The various metrics that are garnered in
this work to support the evaluation of generated code are as follows:
Compilation, NL description to logic conversion, number of edits needed, some
of the commonly used static-code metrics and NLP metrics. These metrics are
applied to 80 codes generated using OpenAI's GPT-3. Post which a Neural network
is designed for binary classification (acceptable/not acceptable quality of the

similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few
pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,
which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between
objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same
album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the
distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning
Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar
group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a
group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that
are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other
images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,
resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in
the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and
GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate
(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results

However, in most cases there are only labelled clean texts. Since there is no

key-value table. Traditional autoregressive methods, though can generate text
with high fluency, suffer from low coverage and poor faithfulness problems. To
mitigate these problems, we propose a novel Skeleton-based two-stage method
that combines both Autoregressive and Non-Autoregressive generations (SANA).
Our approach includes: (1) skeleton generation with an autoregressive pointer
network to select key tokens from the source table; (2) edit-based
non-autoregressive generation model to produce texts via iterative insertion
and deletion operations. By integrating hard constraints from the skeleton, the
non-autoregressive model improves the generation's coverage over the source
table and thus enhances its faithfulness. We conduct automatic and human
evaluations on both WikiPerson and WikiBio datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods
in both automatic and human evaluation, especially on coverage and
faithfulness. In particular, we achieve PARENT-T recall of 99.47 in WikiPerson,
improving over the existing best results by more than 10 points.",2021-05-31

paradigm, pre-extracting a sequence of object-based features and then
formulating image captioning as a single sequence-to-sequence task. Although
promising, we observed two problems in generated captions: 1) content
inconsistency where models would generate contradicting facts; 2) not
informative enough where models would miss parts of important information. From
a causal perspective, the reason is that models have captured spurious
statistical correlations between visual features and certain expressions (e.g.,
visual features of ""long hair"" and ""woman""). In this paper, we propose a
dependent multi-task learning framework with the causal intervention (DMTCI).
Firstly, we involve an intermediate task, bag-of-categories generation, before
the final task, image captioning. The intermediate task would help the model
better understand the visual features and thus alleviate the content
inconsistency problem. Secondly, we apply Pearl's do-calculus on the model,
cutting off the link between the visual features and possible confounders and
thus letting models focus on the causal visual features. Specifically, the
high-frequency concept set is considered as the proxy confounders where the
real confounders are inferred in the continuous space. Finally, we use a
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) strategy to enable end-to-end
training and reduce the inter-task error accumulations. The extensive

generated results, conditional text generators were developed that use input
keywords or attributes to produce the corresponding text. Prior work, however,
do not finely control the diversity of automatically generated sentences. For
example, it does not control the order of keywords to put more relevant ones
first. Moreover, it does not explicitly control the balance between diversity
and accuracy. To remedy these problems, we propose a fine-grained controllable
generative model, called~\textit{Apex}, that uses an algorithm borrowed from
automatic control (namely, a variant of the \textit{proportional, integral, and
derivative (PID) controller}) to precisely manipulate the diversity/accuracy
trade-off of generated text. The algorithm is injected into a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), allowing \textit{Apex} to control both (i) the
order of keywords in the generated sentences (conditioned on the input keywords

attributes. Several studies have noted that naive use of scene graphs from a

graph-based captioning mod-els have to incur the overhead of explicit use of

quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural

inputs consisting of video plus text, speech, or audio. In order to leverage
transformer networks, which have been shown to be effective at modeling
language, each modality is first converted into a set of language embeddings by
a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in
the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion
modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous
inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables
end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network
includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the
multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach
fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different ""video+$x$ to
text"" problems without the need to design specialized network heads for each
task. The proposed framework is not only conceptually simple but also
remarkably effective: experiments demonstrate that our approach based on a
single architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art on three video-based
text-generation tasks -- captioning, question answering and audio-visual

crucial to the success of the software in the market, but designing a good GUI

aggravates designers' working load. So, the availability of various automated
generated GUIs can help enhance the design personalization and specialization
as they can cater to the taste of different designers. To assist designers, we
develop a model GUIGAN to automatically generate GUI designs. Different from
conventional image generation models based on image pixels, our GUIGAN is to
reuse GUI components collected from existing mobile app GUIs for composing a
new design that is similar to natural-language generation. Our GUIGAN is based
on SeqGAN by modeling the GUI component style compatibility and GUI structure.
The evaluation demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms the best
of the baseline methods by 30.77% in Frechet Inception distance (FID) and

existing ZSL methods to text-to-text transformers is non-trivial due to their
text generation objective and huge size. To address these issues, we introduce
Hypter, a framework that improves zero-shot transferability by training a

inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome
requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the
implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a
ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be
accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective
mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist
and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent
training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider
practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective
mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional
variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting
surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in
both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output
diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical
motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed
CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective
mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with
known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural
language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical
surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one
mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for

can, however, be trained on vast amounts of freely available unlabelled data

Next, we employ the same fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Masked
Language Model (MLM), namely BERT, with a visual captioning model, viz. Show,
Attend, and Tell, for emending both syntactic and semantic errors in captions.
Our caption emendation experiments on three benchmark image captioning
datasets, viz. Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO, show improvements over the

existing report generation systems, despite achieving high performances on

incomplete and inconsistent generations, rendering these systems unusable in
practice. In this work, we aim to overcome this problem by proposing two new
metrics that encourage the factual completeness and consistency of generated

generation by its coverage of radiology domain entities against the references.
The second metric, the Entailing Entity Match score, augments the first metric
by introducing a natural language inference model into the entity match process
to encourage consistent generations that can be entailed from the references.
To achieve this, we also developed an in-domain NLI model via weak supervision
to improve its performance on radiology text. We further propose a report
generation system that optimizes these two new metrics via reinforcement
learning. On two open radiology report datasets, our system not only achieves
the best performance on these two metrics compared to baselines, but also leads
to as much as +2.0 improvement on the F1 score of a clinical finding metric. We
show via analysis and examples that our system leads to generations that are
