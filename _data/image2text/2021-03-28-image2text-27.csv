"On Hallucination and Predictive Uncertainty in Conditional Language
  Generation",2021-03-28 00:32:27+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15025v1,"Yijun Xiao, William Yang Wang",cs.CL,image2text,"Despite improvements in performances on different natural language generation
tasks, deep neural models are prone to hallucinating facts that are incorrect
or nonexistent. Different hypotheses are proposed and examined separately for
different tasks, but no systematic explanations are available across these
tasks. In this study, we draw connections between hallucinations and predictive
uncertainty in conditional language generation. We investigate their
relationship in both image captioning and data-to-text generation and propose a
simple extension to beam search to reduce hallucination. Our analysis shows
that higher predictive uncertainty corresponds to a higher chance of
hallucination. Epistemic uncertainty is more indicative of hallucination than
aleatoric or total uncertainties. It helps to achieve better results of trading
performance in standard metric for less hallucination with the proposed beam
search variant.",2021-03-28
Relationship-based Neural Baby Talk,2021-03-08 15:51:24+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04846v1,"Fan Fu, Tingting Xie, Ioannis Patras, Sepehr Jalali","cs.CV, cs.AI",image2text,"Understanding interactions between objects in an image is an important
element for generating captions. In this paper, we propose a relationship-based
neural baby talk (R-NBT) model to comprehensively investigate several types of
pairwise object interactions by encoding each image via three different
relationship-based graph attention networks (GATs). We study three main
relationships: \textit{spatial relationships} to explore geometric
interactions, \textit{semantic relationships} to extract semantic interactions,
and \textit{implicit relationships} to capture hidden information that could
not be modelled explicitly as above. We construct three relationship graphs
with the objects in an image as nodes, and the mutual relationships of pairwise
objects as edges. By exploring features of neighbouring regions individually
via GATs, we integrate different types of relationships into visual features of
each node. Experiments on COCO dataset show that our proposed R-NBT model
outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on COCO dataset in three image
caption generation tasks.",2021-03-08
Controllable and Diverse Text Generation in E-commerce,2021-02-23 05:16:27+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11497v1,"Huajie Shao, Jun Wang, Haohong Lin, Xuezhou Zhang, Aston Zhang, Heng Ji, Tarek Abdelzaher",cs.LG,image2text,"In E-commerce, a key challenge in text generation is to find a good trade-off
between word diversity and accuracy (relevance) in order to make generated text
appear more natural and human-like. In order to improve the relevance of
generated results, conditional text generators were developed that use input
keywords or attributes to produce the corresponding text. Prior work, however,
do not finely control the diversity of automatically generated sentences. For
example, it does not control the order of keywords to put more relevant ones
first. Moreover, it does not explicitly control the balance between diversity
and accuracy. To remedy these problems, we propose a fine-grained controllable
generative model, called~\textit{Apex}, that uses an algorithm borrowed from
automatic control (namely, a variant of the \textit{proportional, integral, and
derivative (PID) controller}) to precisely manipulate the diversity/accuracy
trade-off of generated text. The algorithm is injected into a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), allowing \textit{Apex} to control both (i) the
order of keywords in the generated sentences (conditioned on the input keywords
and their order), and (ii) the trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Evaluation results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms existing generative models in terms of diversity and relevance.
Apex is currently deployed to generate production descriptions and item
recommendation reasons in Taobao owned by Alibaba, the largest E-commerce
platform in China. The A/B production test results show that our method
improves click-through rate (CTR) by 13.17\% compared to the existing method
for production descriptions. For item recommendation reason, it is able to
increase CTR by 6.89\% and 1.42\% compared to user reviews and top-K item
recommendation without reviews, respectively.",2021-02-23
Progressive Transformer-Based Generation of Radiology Reports,2021-02-19 07:42:13+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09777v1,"Farhad Nooralahzadeh, Nicolas Perez Gonzalez, Thomas Frauenfelder, Koji Fujimoto, Michael Krauthammer",cs.CL,image2text,"Inspired by Curriculum Learning, we propose a consecutive (i.e.

from the image in the first step and then reforms them into finer and coherent
texts using transformer-based architecture. We follow the transformer-based
sequence-to-sequence paradigm at each step. We improve upon the

that the human annotations, i.e., the descriptions of video contents in the

captions contain grammatical problems. These problems may pose difficulties to
video captioning models for learning. We cleaned the MSR-VTT annotations by
removing these problems, then tested several typical video captioning models on
the cleaned dataset. Experimental results showed that data cleaning boosted the

SG2Caps: Revisiting Scene Graphs for Image Captioning,2021-02-09 18:00:53+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04990v1,"Subarna Tripathi, Kien Nguyen, Tanaya Guha, Bang Du, Truong Q. Nguyen","cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"The mainstream image captioning models rely on Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) image features with an additional attention to salient regions and
objects to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, scene graph
representations of images have been used to augment captioning models so as to
leverage their structural semantics, such as object entities, relationships and
attributes. Several studies have noted that naive use of scene graphs from a
black-box scene graph generator harms image caption-ing performance, and scene
graph-based captioning mod-els have to incur the overhead of explicit use of
image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we
propose a framework, SG2Caps, that utilizes only the scene graph labels for
competitive image caption-ing performance. The basic idea is to close the
semantic gap between two scene graphs - one derived from the input image and
the other one from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the
spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an
additional HOI graph. Our framework outperforms existing scene graph-only
captioning models by a large margin (CIDEr score of 110 vs 71) indicating scene
graphs as a promising representation for image captioning. Direct utilization
of the scene graph labels avoids expensive graph convolutions over
high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49%fewer trainable parameters.",2021-02-09
Controlling Hallucinations at Word Level in Data-to-Text Generation,2021-02-04 18:58:28+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.02810v1,"Clément Rebuffel, Marco Roberti, Laure Soulier, Geoffrey Scoutheeten, Rossella Cancelliere, Patrick Gallinari","cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, 68T50 (Primary), 68T07 (Secondary), 68T05, I.2.6; I.2.7",image2text,"Data-to-Text Generation (DTG) is a subfield of Natural Language Generation
aiming at transcribing structured data in natural language descriptions. The
field has been recently boosted by the use of neural-based generators which
exhibit on one side great syntactic skills without the need of hand-crafted
pipelines; on the other side, the quality of the generated text reflects the
quality of the training data, which in realistic settings only offer
imperfectly aligned structure-text pairs. Consequently, state-of-art neural
models include misleading statements - usually called hallucinations - in their
outputs. The control of this phenomenon is today a major challenge for DTG, and
is the problem addressed in the paper.
  Previous work deal with this issue at the instance level: using an alignment
score for each table-reference pair. In contrast, we propose a finer-grained
approach, arguing that hallucinations should rather be treated at the word
level. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Branch Decoder which is able to
leverage word-level labels to learn the relevant parts of each training
instance. These labels are obtained following a simple and efficient scoring
procedure based on co-occurrence analysis and dependency parsing. Extensive
evaluations, via automated metrics and human judgment on the standard WikiBio
benchmark, show the accuracy of our alignment labels and the effectiveness of
the proposed Multi-Branch Decoder. Our model is able to reduce and control
hallucinations, while keeping fluency and coherence in generated texts. Further
experiments on a degraded version of ToTTo show that our model could be
successfully used on very noisy settings.",2021-02-04

framework that learns different tasks in a single architecture with the same
language modeling objective, i.e., multimodal conditional text generation,
where our models learn to generate labels in text based on the visual and
textual inputs. On 7 popular vision-and-language benchmarks, including visual
question answering, referring expression comprehension, visual commonsense
reasoning, most of which have been previously modeled as discriminative tasks,
our generative approach (with a single unified architecture) reaches comparable
performance to recent task-specific state-of-the-art vision-and-language
models. Moreover, our generative approach shows better generalization ability
on answering questions that have rare answers. In addition, we show that our
framework allows multi-task learning in a single architecture with a single set
of parameters, which achieves similar performance to separately optimized

a learnable tokenizer. This allows our approach to perform multimodal fusion in
the language space, thus eliminating the need for ad-hoc cross-modal fusion
modules. To address the non-differentiability of tokenization on continuous
inputs (e.g., video or audio), we utilize a relaxation scheme that enables
end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike prior encoder-only models, our network
includes an autoregressive decoder to generate open-ended text from the
multimodal embeddings fused by the language encoder. This renders our approach
fully generative and makes it directly applicable to different ""video+$x$ to

ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be
accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective
mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist

training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider
practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective
mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional
variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting
surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in
both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output
diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical
motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed

  Radiology Report Generation",2020-10-20 05:42:47+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10042v1,"Yasuhide Miura, Yuhao Zhang, Curtis P. Langlotz, Dan Jurafsky",cs.CL,image2text,"Neural image-to-text radiology report generation systems offer the potential
to accelerate clinical processes by saving radiologists from the repetitive
labor of drafting radiology reports and preventing medical errors. However,
existing report generation systems, despite achieving high performances on
natural language generation metrics such as CIDEr or BLEU, still suffer from
incomplete and inconsistent generations, rendering these systems unusable in
practice. In this work, we aim to overcome this problem by proposing two new
metrics that encourage the factual completeness and consistency of generated
radiology reports. The first metric, the Exact Entity Match score, evaluates a
generation by its coverage of radiology domain entities against the references.
The second metric, the Entailing Entity Match score, augments the first metric
by introducing a natural language inference model into the entity match process
to encourage consistent generations that can be entailed from the references.
To achieve this, we also developed an in-domain NLI model via weak supervision
to improve its performance on radiology text. We further propose a report
generation system that optimizes these two new metrics via reinforcement
learning. On two open radiology report datasets, our system not only achieves
the best performance on these two metrics compared to baselines, but also leads
to as much as +2.0 improvement on the F1 score of a clinical finding metric. We
show via analysis and examples that our system leads to generations that are
more complete and consistent compared to the baselines.",2020-10-20

  Semantic Annotations for Task-Oriented Dialogue Modeling",2020-10-17 08:18:59+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08738v1,"Jun Quan, Shian Zhang, Qian Cao, Zizhong Li, Deyi Xiong",cs.CL,image2text,"In order to alleviate the shortage of multi-domain data and to capture
discourse phenomena for task-oriented dialogue modeling, we propose RiSAWOZ, a
large-scale multi-domain Chinese Wizard-of-Oz dataset with Rich Semantic
Annotations. RiSAWOZ contains 11.2K human-to-human (H2H) multi-turn
semantically annotated dialogues, with more than 150K utterances spanning over
12 domains, which is larger than all previous annotated H2H conversational
datasets. Both single- and multi-domain dialogues are constructed, accounting
for 65% and 35%, respectively. Each dialogue is labeled with comprehensive
dialogue annotations, including dialogue goal in the form of natural language
description, domain, dialogue states and acts at both the user and system side.
In addition to traditional dialogue annotations, we especially provide
linguistic annotations on discourse phenomena, e.g., ellipsis and coreference,
in dialogues, which are useful for dialogue coreference and ellipsis resolution
tasks. Apart from the fully annotated dataset, we also present a detailed
description of the data collection procedure, statistics and analysis of the
dataset. A series of benchmark models and results are reported, including
natural language understanding (intent detection & slot filling), dialogue
state tracking and dialogue context-to-text generation, as well as coreference
and ellipsis resolution, which facilitate the baseline comparison for future
research on this corpus.",2020-10-17
Dissecting the components and factors of Neural Text Generation,2020-10-14 17:54:42+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07279v1,"Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Alan W Black",cs.CL,image2text,"Neural text generation metamorphosed into several critical natural language
applications ranging from text completion to free form narrative generation.
Generating natural language has fundamentally been a human attribute and the
advent of ubiquitous NLP applications and virtual agents marks the need to
impart this skill to machines. There has been a colossal research effort in
various frontiers of neural text generation including machine translation,
summarization, image captioning, storytelling etc., We believe that this is an
excellent juncture to retrospect on the directions of the field. Specifically,
this paper surveys the fundamental factors and components relaying task
agnostic impacts across various generation tasks such as storytelling,
summarization, translation etc., In specific, we present an abstraction of the
imperative techniques with respect to learning paradigms, pretraining, modeling
approaches, decoding and the key challenges. Thereby, we hope to deliver a
one-stop destination for researchers in the field to facilitate a perspective
on where to situate their work and how it impacts other closely related tasks.",2020-10-14

  Chest X-rays",2020-10-06 04:18:18+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02467v1,"Jianmo Ni, Chun-Nan Hsu, Amilcare Gentili, Julian McAuley","cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"Automatic medical image report generation has drawn growing attention due to
its potential to alleviate radiologists' workload. Existing work on report
generation often trains encoder-decoder networks to generate complete reports.
However, such models are affected by data bias (e.g.~label imbalance) and face
common issues inherent in text generation models (e.g.~repetition). In this
work, we focus on reporting abnormal findings on radiology images; instead of
training on complete radiology reports, we propose a method to identify
abnormal findings from the reports in addition to grouping them with
unsupervised clustering and minimal rules. We formulate the task as cross-modal
retrieval and propose Conditional Visual-Semantic Embeddings to align images
and fine-grained abnormal findings in a joint embedding space. We demonstrate
that our method is able to retrieve abnormal findings and outperforms existing
generation models on both clinical correctness and text generation metrics.",2020-10-06

  Neural Network",2020-10-04 03:54:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01480v1,"Junyi Li, Siqing Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Gaole He, Zhicheng Wei, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Ji-Rong Wen","cs.CL, cs.AI",image2text,"Personalized review generation (PRG) aims to automatically produce review
text reflecting user preference, which is a challenging natural language
generation task. Most of previous studies do not explicitly model factual
description of products, tending to generate uninformative content. Moreover,
they mainly focus on word-level generation, but cannot accurately reflect more
abstractive user preference in multiple aspects. To address the above issues,
we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced PRG model based on capsule graph neural
network~(Caps-GNN). We first construct a heterogeneous knowledge graph (HKG)
for utilizing rich item attributes. We adopt Caps-GNN to learn graph capsules
for encoding underlying characteristics from the HKG. Our generation process
contains two major steps, namely aspect sequence generation and sentence
generation. First, based on graph capsules, we adaptively learn aspect capsules
for inferring the aspect sequence. Then, conditioned on the inferred aspect
label, we design a graph-based copy mechanism to generate sentences by
incorporating related entities or words from HKG. To our knowledge, we are the
first to utilize knowledge graph for the PRG task. The incorporated KG
information is able to enhance user preference at both aspect and word levels.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our model on the PRG task.",2020-10-04
