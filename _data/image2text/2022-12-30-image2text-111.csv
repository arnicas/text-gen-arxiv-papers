MAUVE Scores for Generative Models: Theory and Practice,2022-12-30 07:37:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14578v1,"Krishna Pillutla, Lang Liu, John Thickstun, Sean Welleck, Swabha Swayamdipta, Rowan Zellers, Sewoong Oh, Yejin Choi, Zaid Harchaoui","cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL",image2text,"Generative AI has matured to a point where large-scale models can generate
text that seems indistinguishable from human-written text and remarkably
photorealistic images. Automatically measuring how close the distribution of
generated data is to the target real data distribution is a key step in
diagnosing existing models and developing better models. We present MAUVE, a
family of comparison measures between pairs of distributions such as those
encountered in the generative modeling of text or images. These scores are
statistical summaries of divergence frontiers capturing two types of errors in
generative modeling. We explore four approaches to statistically estimate these
scores: vector quantization, non-parametric estimation, classifier-based
estimation, and parametric Gaussian approximations. We provide statistical
bounds for the vector quantization approach. Empirically, we find that the
proposed scores paired with a range of $f$-divergences and statistical
estimation methods can quantify the gaps between the distributions of
human-written text and those of modern neural language models by correlating
with human judgments and identifying known properties of the generated texts.
We conclude the paper by demonstrating its applications to other AI domains and
discussing practical recommendations.",2022-12-30
"Noise-aware Learning from Web-crawled Image-Text Data for Image
  Captioning",2022-12-27 17:33:40+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13563v1,"Wooyoung Kang, Jonghwan Mun, Sungjun Lee, Byungseok Roh","cs.CV, cs.AI",image2text,"Image captioning is one of the straightforward tasks that can take advantage
of large-scale web-crawled data which provides rich knowledge about the visual
world for a captioning model. However, since web-crawled data contains
image-text pairs that are aligned at different levels, the inherent noises
(e.g., misaligned pairs) make it difficult to learn a precise captioning model.
While the filtering strategy can effectively remove noisy data, however, it
leads to a decrease in learnable knowledge and sometimes brings about a new
problem of data deficiency. To take the best of both worlds, we propose a
noise-aware learning framework, which learns rich knowledge from the whole
web-crawled data while being less affected by the noises. This is achieved by
the proposed quality controllable model, which is learned using alignment
levels of the image-text pairs as an additional control signal during training.
The alignment-conditioned training allows the model to generate high-quality
captions of well-aligned by simply setting the control signal to desired
alignment level at inference time. Through in-depth analysis, we show that our
controllable captioning model is effective in handling noise. In addition, with
two tasks of zero-shot captioning and text-to-image retrieval using generated
captions (i.e., self-retrieval), we also demonstrate our model can produce
high-quality captions in terms of descriptiveness and distinctiveness. Code is

breakthroughs that exhibit Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) breaking the

neural architecture, Transformer, as a backbone foundation model and its
generalization to various tasks, including computer vision, natural language

tasks as a sequence decoding task using the Transformer architecture; this
would be a promising solution to advance the applications of IDM in more
complex real world tasks. In this paper, we elaborate on how a foundation
decision model improves the efficiency and generalization of IDM. We also
discuss potential applications of a FDM in multi-agent game AI, production

our realization of the FDM, DigitalBrain (DB1) with 1.2 billion parameters,

to understand the semantics of images which are then transformed into text. An
important question is: which annotation reflects best a deep understanding of

describe the characteristic details of input images. However, recent
high-performing captioning models, which are trained with reinforcement
learning (RL), tend to generate overly generic captions despite their high
performance in various other criteria. First, we investigate the cause of the
unexpectedly low discriminativeness and show that RL has a deeply rooted side
effect of limiting the output words to high-frequency words. The limited
vocabulary is a severe bottleneck for discriminativeness as it is difficult for
a model to describe the details beyond its vocabulary. Then, based on this
identification of the bottleneck, we drastically recast discriminative image
captioning as a much simpler task of encouraging low-frequency word generation.
Hinted by long-tail classification and debiasing methods, we propose methods
that easily switch off-the-shelf RL models to discriminativeness-aware models

the content of audio clips with natural language sentences. This task has
attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent

deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple
(e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating
the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe
the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound
events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct

ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across
similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework
based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve
diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid
discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can
be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and
the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different

Here, we make the first attempt to achieve generic text-guided cross-category

accessibility and effectiveness. However, there is a chronic shortage of
well-trained radiologists who can interpret these images and diagnose the
patient's condition. Therefore, automated radiology report generation can be a
very helpful tool in clinical practice. A typical report generation workflow
consists of two main steps: (i) encoding the image into a latent space and (ii)
generating the text of the report based on the latent image embedding. Many
existing report generation techniques use a standard convolutional neural
network (CNN) architecture for image encoding followed by a Transformer-based
decoder for medical text generation. In most cases, CNN and the decoder are
trained jointly in an end-to-end fashion. In this work, we primarily focus on
understanding the relative importance of encoder and decoder components.
Towards this end, we analyze four different image encoding approaches: direct,
fine-grained, CLIP-based, and Cluster-CLIP-based encodings in conjunction with
three different decoders on the large-scale MIMIC-CXR dataset. Among these
encoders, the cluster CLIP visual encoder is a novel approach that aims to
generate more discriminative and explainable representations. CLIP-based
encoders produce comparable results to traditional CNN-based encoders in terms
of NLP metrics, while fine-grained encoding outperforms all other encoders both

utilizing video-to-pivot captioning model to generate captions in pivot
language and then utilizing pivot-to-target translation model to translate the
pivot captions to the target language. However, in such a pipeline system, 1)
visual information cannot reach the translation model, generating visual
irrelevant target captions; 2) the errors in the generated pivot captions will
be propagated to the translation model, resulting in disfluent target captions.
To address these problems, we propose the Unpaired Video Captioning with Visual

source visual information into the target language domain. Meanwhile, VIM
directly connects the encoder of the video-to-pivot model and the decoder of
the pivot-to-target model, allowing end-to-end inference by completely skipping
the generation of pivot captions. To enhance the cross-modality injection of
the VIM, UVC-VI further introduces a pluggable video encoder, i.e., Multimodal

text-conditioned high-resolution image synthesis. Starting from random noise,
such text-to-image diffusion models gradually synthesize images in an iterative
fashion while conditioning on text prompts. We find that their synthesis
behavior qualitatively changes throughout this process: Early in sampling,
generation strongly relies on the text prompt to generate text-aligned content,
while later, the text conditioning is almost entirely ignored. This suggests
that sharing model parameters throughout the entire generation process may not
be ideal. Therefore, in contrast to existing works, we propose to train an
ensemble of text-to-image diffusion models specialized for different synthesis
stages. To maintain training efficiency, we initially train a single model,
which is then split into specialized models that are trained for the specific
stages of the iterative generation process. Our ensemble of diffusion models,
called eDiff-I, results in improved text alignment while maintaining the same
inference computation cost and preserving high visual quality, outperforming
previous large-scale text-to-image diffusion models on the standard benchmark.
In addition, we train our model to exploit a variety of embeddings for
conditioning, including the T5 text, CLIP text, and CLIP image embeddings. We
show that these different embeddings lead to different behaviors. Notably, the
CLIP image embedding allows an intuitive way of transferring the style of a
reference image to the target text-to-image output. Lastly, we show a technique
that enables eDiff-I's ""paint-with-words"" capability. A user can select the
word in the input text and paint it in a canvas to control the output, which is
very handy for crafting the desired image in mind. The project page is

leverages PDA states to help CODEP comprehend the parsing process of the PDA

be directly applied to Seq2Seq models without training to ensure the
grammatical correctness of the generated code. To evaluate the effectiveness of

present an increased complexity in architecture that offers only marginal

Aligning cross-modal semantics is claimed to be one of the essential
capabilities of VLP models. However, it still remains unclear about the inner
working mechanism of alignment in VLP models. In this paper, we propose a new
probing method that is based on image captioning to first empirically study the
cross-modal semantics alignment of VLP models. Our probing method is built upon
the fact that given an image-caption pair, the VLP models will give a score,
indicating how well two modalities are aligned; maximizing such scores will
generate sentences that VLP models believe are of good alignment. Analyzing
these sentences thus will reveal in what way different modalities are aligned
and how well these alignments are in VLP models. We apply our probing method to
five popular VLP models, including UNITER, ROSITA, ViLBERT, CLIP, and LXMERT,
and provide a comprehensive analysis of the generated captions guided by these
models. Our results show that VLP models (1) focus more on just aligning
objects with visual words, while neglecting global semantics; (2) prefer fixed
sentence patterns, thus ignoring more important textual information including
fluency and grammar; and (3) deem the captions with more visual words are
better aligned with images. These findings indicate that VLP models still have
weaknesses in cross-modal semantics alignment and we hope this work will draw
researchers' attention to such problems when designing a new VLP model.",2022-10-18

relevant cells and irrelevant cells from the structural perspective. Our
framework also modifies the positional encoding mechanism to preserve the
relative position of tokens in the same cell but enforce position invariance

proposed decoding scheme does not involve any gradient update operation,
therefore being computationally efficient. On the challenging task of zero-shot
image captioning, MAGIC outperforms the state-of-the-art method by notable

lacks distinctiveness, i.e., many similar images have the same caption. In this
paper, we aim to improve the distinctiveness of image captions via comparing

distinctiveness metric -- between-set CIDEr (CIDErBtw) to evaluate the
distinctiveness of a caption with respect to those of similar images. Our
metric reveals that the human annotations of each image in the MSCOCO dataset
are not equivalent based on distinctiveness; however, previous works normally
treat the human annotations equally during training, which could be a reason
for generating less distinctive captions. In contrast, we reweight each
ground-truth caption according to its distinctiveness during training. We
further integrate a long-tailed weight strategy to highlight the rare words
that contain more information, and captions from the similar image set are
sampled as negative examples to encourage the generated sentence to be unique.
Finally, extensive experiments are conducted, showing that our proposed
approach significantly improves both distinctiveness (as measured by CIDErBtw
and retrieval metrics) and accuracy (e.g., as measured by CIDEr) for a wide

apply the pretrained transformer for the binary classification of facial images
in criminal and non-criminal classes. The pretrained transformer of GPT-2 is
trained to generate text and then fine-tuned to classify facial images. During
the finetuning process with images, most of the layers of GT-2 are frozen
during backpropagation and the model is frozen pretrained transformer (FPT).
The FPT acts as a universal image classifier, and this paper shows the
application of FPT on facial images. We also use our FPT on encrypted images
for classification. Our FPT shows high accuracy on both raw facial images and
encrypted images. We hypothesize the meta-learning capacity FPT gained because
of its large size and trained on a large size with theory and experiments. The
GPT-2 trained to generate a single word token at a time, through the
autoregressive process, forced to heavy-tail distribution. Then the FPT uses
the heavy-tail property as its meta-learning capacity for classifying images.
Our work shows one way to avoid bias during the machine classification of
images.The FPT encodes worldly knowledge because of the pretraining of one
text, which it uses during the classification. The statistical error of
classification is reduced because of the added context gained from the text.Our
paper shows the ethical dimension of using encrypted data for
classification.Criminal images are sensitive to share across the boundary but
encrypted largely evades ethical concern.FPT showing good classification

executed sequentially. In this paper, we introduce a Compact Bidirectional
Transformer model for image captioning that can leverage bidirectional context
implicitly and explicitly while the decoder can be executed parallelly.
Specifically, it is implemented by tightly coupling left-to-right(L2R) and
right-to-left(R2L) flows into a single compact model~(i.e. implicitly) and
optionally allowing interaction of the two flows(i.e. explicitly), while the
final caption is chosen from either L2R or R2L flow in a sentence-level

implicitly exploiting bidirectional context, and the sentence-level ensemble
play more important roles than the explicit interaction mechanism. By combining
with word-level ensemble seamlessly, the effect of the sentence-level ensemble

corpora of uncurated pairs of images and sentences. While such models can
provide a powerful score for matching and subsequent zero-shot tasks, they are
not capable of generating caption given an image. In this work, we repurpose
such models to generate a descriptive text given an image at inference time,
without any further training or tuning step. This is done by combining the
visual-semantic model with a large language model, benefiting from the
knowledge in both web-scale models. The resulting captions are much less
restrictive than those obtained by supervised captioning methods. Moreover, as
a zero-shot learning method, it is extremely flexible and we demonstrate its
ability to perform image arithmetic in which the inputs can be either images or
text and the output is a sentence. This enables novel high-level vision
capabilities such as comparing two images or solving visual analogy tests.",2021-11-29
LAFITE: Towards Language-Free Training for Text-to-Image Generation,2021-11-27 01:54:45+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13792v1,"Yufan Zhou, Ruiyi Zhang, Changyou Chen, Chunyuan Li, Chris Tensmeyer, Tong Yu, Jiuxiang Gu, Jinhui Xu, Tong Sun","cs.CV, cs.LG",image2text,"One of the major challenges in training text-to-image generation models is
the need of a large number of high-quality image-text pairs. While image
samples are often easily accessible, the associated text descriptions typically
require careful human captioning, which is particularly time- and
cost-consuming. In this paper, we propose the first work to train text-to-image
generation models without any text data. Our method leverages the well-aligned
multi-modal semantic space of the powerful pre-trained CLIP model: the
requirement of text-conditioning is seamlessly alleviated via generating text
features from image features. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method. We obtain state-of-the-art results in
the standard text-to-image generation tasks. Importantly, the proposed
language-free model outperforms most existing models trained with full
image-text pairs. Furthermore, our method can be applied in fine-tuning
pre-trained models, which saves both training time and cost in training
text-to-image generation models. Our pre-trained model obtains competitive
results in zero-shot text-to-image generation on the MS-COCO dataset, yet with
around only 1% of the model size and training data size relative to the
recently proposed large DALL-E model.",2021-11-27
"Octree Transformer: Autoregressive 3D Shape Generation on Hierarchically
  Structured Sequences",2021-11-24 13:17:16+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12480v1,"Moritz Ibing, Gregor Kobsik, Leif Kobbelt","cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG",image2text,"Autoregressive models have proven to be very powerful in NLP text generation
tasks and lately have gained popularity for image generation as well. However,
they have seen limited use for the synthesis of 3D shapes so far. This is
mainly due to the lack of a straightforward way to linearize 3D data as well as
to scaling problems with the length of the resulting sequences when describing
complex shapes. In this work we address both of these problems. We use octrees
as a compact hierarchical shape representation that can be sequentialized by
traversal ordering. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive compression scheme, that
significantly reduces sequence lengths and thus enables their effective
generation with a transformer, while still allowing fully autoregressive
sampling and parallel training. We demonstrate the performance of our model by
comparing against the state-of-the-art in shape generation.",2021-11-24
NÜWA: Visual Synthesis Pre-training for Neural visUal World creAtion,2021-11-24 11:02:12+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12417v1,"Chenfei Wu, Jian Liang, Lei Ji, Fan Yang, Yuejian Fang, Daxin Jiang, Nan Duan","cs.CV, cs.AI",image2text,"This paper presents a unified multimodal pre-trained model called N\""UWA that
can generate new or manipulate existing visual data (i.e., images and videos)
for various visual synthesis tasks. To cover language, image, and video at the
same time for different scenarios, a 3D transformer encoder-decoder framework
is designed, which can not only deal with videos as 3D data but also adapt to
texts and images as 1D and 2D data, respectively. A 3D Nearby Attention (3DNA)
mechanism is also proposed to consider the nature of the visual data and reduce
the computational complexity. We evaluate N\""UWA on 8 downstream tasks.
Compared to several strong baselines, N\""UWA achieves state-of-the-art results
on text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, video prediction, etc.
Furthermore, it also shows surprisingly good zero-shot capabilities on
text-guided image and video manipulation tasks. Project repo is

Scaling Up Vision-Language Pre-training for Image Captioning,2021-11-24 02:30:22+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12233v1,"Xiaowei Hu, Zhe Gan, Jianfeng Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Zicheng Liu, Yumao Lu, Lijuan Wang","cs.CV, cs.CL",image2text,"In recent years, we have witnessed significant performance boost in the image
captioning task based on vision-language pre-training (VLP). Scale is believed
to be an important factor for this advance. However, most existing work only
focuses on pre-training transformers with moderate sizes (e.g., 12 or 24
layers) on roughly 4 million images. In this paper, we present LEMON, a
LargE-scale iMage captiONer, and provide the first empirical study on the
scaling behavior of VLP for image captioning. We use the state-of-the-art VinVL
model as our reference model, which consists of an image feature extractor and
a transformer model, and scale the transformer both up and down, with model
sizes ranging from 13 to 675 million parameters. In terms of data, we conduct
experiments with up to 200 million image-text pairs which are automatically
collected from web based on the alt attribute of the image (dubbed as ALT200M).
Extensive analysis helps to characterize the performance trend as the model
size and the pre-training data size increase. We also compare different
training recipes, especially for training on large-scale noisy data. As a
result, LEMON achieves new state of the arts on several major image captioning
benchmarks, including COCO Caption, nocaps, and Conceptual Captions. We also
show LEMON can generate captions with long-tail visual concepts when used in a
zero-shot manner.",2021-11-24
L-Verse: Bidirectional Generation Between Image and Text,2021-11-22 11:48:26+00:00,http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.11133v3,"Taehoon Kim, Gwangmo Song, Sihaeng Lee, Sangyun Kim, Yewon Seo, Soonyoung Lee, Seung Hwan Kim, Honglak Lee, Kyunghoon Bae","cs.CV, cs.CL, cs.LG",image2text,"Far beyond learning long-range interactions of natural language, transformers
are becoming the de-facto standard for many vision tasks with their power and
scalabilty. Especially with cross-modal tasks between image and text, vector
quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are widely used to make a raw RGB
image into a sequence of feature vectors. To better leverage the correlation
between image and text, we propose L-Verse, a novel architecture consisting of
feature-augmented variational autoencoder (AugVAE) and bidirectional
auto-regressive transformer (BiART) for text-to-image and image-to-text
generation. Our AugVAE shows the state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on
ImageNet1K validation set, along with the robustness to unseen images in the
wild. Unlike other models, BiART can distinguish between image (or text) as a
conditional reference and a generation target. L-Verse can be directly used for
image-to-text or text-to-image generation tasks without any finetuning or extra
object detection frameworks. In quantitative and qualitative experiments,
L-Verse shows impressive results against previous methods in both image-to-text
and text-to-image generation on MS-COCO Captions. We furthermore assess the
scalability of L-Verse architecture on Conceptual Captions and present the
initial results of bidirectional vision-language representation learning on
general domain. Codes available at: https://github.com/tgisaturday/L-Verse",2021-11-22
